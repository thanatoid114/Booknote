abstract="The basic perturbation theoretic method for dealing with non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanical problems has been known for years. The theory discussed here evolved from the work of Schwinger and was developed further by Kadanoff and Baym1. In fact virtually all the theory discussed here is contained in Kadanoff's and Baym's book. Essentially the same theory was developed independently by Keldysh2 who even anticipates a rather useful addendum by Craig3.",
