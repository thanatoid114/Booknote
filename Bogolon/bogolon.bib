	abstract = {We propose to unleash an optical spectroscopy technique to monitor the superconductivity and properties of superconductors in the fluctuating regime. This technique is operational close to the plasmon resonance frequency of the material, and it intimately connects with the superconducting fluctuations slightly above the critical temperature {\$}T{\_}c{\$}. We find the Aslamazov-Larkin corrections to AC linear and DC nonlinear electric current in a generic two-dimensional system exposed to an external longitudinal electromagnetic field. First, we study the plasmon resonance of normal electrons near {\$}T{\_}c{\$}, taking into account their interaction with superconducting fluctuations, and show that fluctuating Cooper pairs reveal an additional mechanism of plasmon damping, which surpasses the electron-impurity scattering. Second, we demonstrate the emergence of a drag effect of superconducting fluctuations by the external field resulting in considerable, experimentally measurable corrections to the electric current in the vicinity of the plasmon resonance.},

	abstract = {We introduce a family of asymmetric Laguerre-Gaussian (aLG) laser beams. The beams have been derived via a complex-valued shift of conventional LG beams in the Cartesian plane. While propagating in a uniform medium, the first bright ring of the aLG beam becomes less asymmetric and the energy is redistributed toward peripheral diffraction rings. The projection of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) onto the optical axis is calculated. The OAM is shown to grow quadratically with increasing asymmetry parameter of the aLG beam, which equals the ratio of the shift to the waist radius. Conditions for the OAM becoming equal to the topological charge have been derived. For aLG beams with zero radial index, we have deduced an expression to define the intensity maximum coordinates and shown the crescent-shaped intensity pattern to rotate during propagation. Results of the experimental generation and rotation of aLG beams agree well with theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {We describe the behavior of a repulsively interacting Bose-Einstein condensate of indirect dipolar exciton gas in a double quantum well (QW) system under external static or dynamic electric fields at finite temperatures. Electrostatic perturbation is considered to be created by an impurity atom or shot-range defect of QW fluctuation. The screening of this defect potential by an exciton condensate is studied. We find asymptotic spatial dependence of the screened potential and analyse its dependence on the temperature and exciton concentration. It is shown that the asymptotic of the screened potential has a steep power law dependence in contrast to the well known results of electron gas. This peculiarity reflects the bosonic nature of the exciton condensate. The behavior of exciton condensate under external alternative field created by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) is examined in detail. We focus our attention on the dependence of SAW absorption coefficient on temperature and exciton concentration. We found that at zero temperatures Landau damping does not contribute to the SAW absorption, but the Belyaev mechanism produces unusual behavior of SAW absorption coefficient on exciton concentration: if the exciton concentration exceeds some critical value, the SAW absorption vanishes. At finite temperatures Landau damping comes into action and results in washing out the sharp absorption behavior. Such unusual SAW absorption properties can be used for experimental evidence of the exciton condensation. This method is also applicable to the experimental testing of both dark and bright exciton condensates, that is impossible to do with the optical luminescence technique.},

	abstract = {We report on the novel valley acoustoelectric effect, which can arise in a 2D material, like a transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer, residing on a piezoelectric substrate. The essence of this effect lies in the emergence of a drag electric current (and a spin current) due to a propagating surface acoustic wave. This current consists of three contributions, one independent of the valley index and proportional to the acoustic wave vector, the other arising due to the trigonal warping of the electron dispersion, and the third one is due to the Berry phase, which Bloch electrons acquire traveling along the crystal. As a result, there appear components of the current orthogonal to the acoustic wave vector. Further, we build an angular pattern, encompassing nontrivial topological properties of the acoustoelectric current, and suggest a way to run and measure the conventional diffusive, warping, and acoustoelectric valley Hall currents independently. We develop a theory, which opens a way to manipulate valley transport by acoustic methods, expanding the applicability of valleytronic effects on acoustoelectronic devices.},

	abstract = {We investigate theoretically the magnetoplasmon (cyclotron) resonance in a hybrid system consisting of spatially separated two-dimensional layers of electron and dipolar exciton gases coupled via Coulomb forces. We study the dynamics of this system under the action of a weak alternating external electromagnetic field in the presence of a uniform magnetic field, perpendicular to the layers. We reveal that the electromagnetic power absorption exhibits a double-resonance spectrum. We show that the first resonance is associated with the conventional well-studied magnetoplasmon excitations of the electron gas and it has a standard Lorentzian shape, whereas the second resonance is a peculiarity attributed to the Bose-condensed exciton gas. Further, we explicitly demonstrate that the spectrum of the system exhibits an asymmetric Fano-type profile, where the excitonic peak is extremely narrow in comparison with the magnetoplasmon one. We show that the shape of the resonance and the position of the peaks depend on the magnitude of the applied magnetic field, exciton-condensate density, and exciton-impurity scattering time. In particular, the Fano profile turns into a Lorentzian shape with decreasing exciton-impurity scattering time and the position of the plasmon-associated resonance is mainly sensitive and determined by the magnetic field strength, whereas the exciton-condensate peak position is determined by the exciton-condensate density. It opens the experimental possibility to determine the latter quantity in cyclotron resonance experiments.},
