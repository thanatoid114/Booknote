abstract = {From a theoretical point of view, we discuss a variety of phenomena linked to the spin and polarization degree of freedom of exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. We start with linear optical effects including the optical spin Hall effect, formation of polarization vortices and ballistic propagation of polarized exciton-polaritons. Next, the interplay between spin-dependent dynamics and Bose condensation in the 2D system of microcavity polaritons is addressed. Theoretically, this many-body system of interacting particles is described by the spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations. These equations provide a description of the time evolution of polarized polariton fields under different conditions of optical excitation as well as an understanding of the phenomena of superfluidity, multistability and hysteresis via renormalization of the dispersion of elementary excitations. The comprehension of polarization-sensitive dynamics can be made through the introduction of several effective fields of different nature acting on the polariton pseudospin. The theory of parametric scattering of exciton-polaritons is presented, using the second quantization formalism. It is found that the combination of nonlinearity and various mechanisms of spin reorientation leads to self-organization and the formation of polarized patterns such as polarization crosses, vortices and rings. The manipulation of polariton spins can lead to various applications in signal processing, including the construction of optical logic gates and spin memory elements; the creation of spin currents; and the control of polarized signal propagation in the microcavity plane. The concept of polariton neurons is discussed in this connection. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Analytical results are derived for the impurity energy, effective mass, and residue to third order in the impurity-boson scattering length. The energy is shown to depend logarithmically on the scattering length to third order, whereas the residue and the effective mass are given by analytical power series. When the boson-boson scattering length equals the boson-impurity scattering length, the energy has the same structure as that of a weakly interacting Bose gas, including terms of the Lee-Huang-Yang and fourth order logarithmic form. Our results, which cannot be obtained within the canonical Fr{\"{o}}hlich model of an impurity interacting with phonons, provide valuable benchmarks for many-body theories and for experiments.},

abstract = {All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say that what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in the laboratory. But the essence of quantum formalism-entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and Schr{\"{o}}dinger-waited over 70 years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal form-the bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Exciton polaritons are coupled states of matter and light, originated by the strong interaction between an optical mode and semiconductor excitons. This interaction can be obtained also at a single-particle level, in which case it has been shown that a quantum treatment is mandatory. In this work we study the light-matter entanglement of polaritons from a fully quantum formalism including pumping and dissipation. We find that the entanglement is completely destroyed if the exciton and photon are tuned at the resonance condition, even under very low pumping rates. Instead, the best condition for maximizing entanglement and purity of the steady state is when the exciton and photon are out of resonance and when incoherent pumping exactly compensates the dissipation rate. In the presence of multiple quantum dots coupled to the light mode, matter-light entanglement survives only at larger detuning for a higher number of quantum dots considered.},

abstract = {Superfluidity, the ability of a quantum fluid to flow without friction, is one of the most spectacular phenomena occurring in degenerate gases of interacting bosons. Since its first discovery in liquid helium-4 (refs1, 2), superfluidity has been observed in quite different systems, and recent experiments with ultracold trapped atoms have explored the subtle links between superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation. In solid-state systems, it has been anticipated that exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities should behave as an unusual quantum fluid, with unique properties stemming from its intrinsically non-equilibrium nature. This has stimulated the quest for an experimental demonstration of superfluidity effects in polariton systems. Here, we report clear evidence for superfluid motion of polaritons. Superfluidity is investigated in terms of the Landau criterion and manifests itself as the suppression of scattering from defects when the flow velocity is slower than the speed of sound in the fluid. Moreover, a erenkov-like wake pattern is observed when the flow velocity exceeds the speed of sound. The experimental findings are in quantitative agreement with predictions based on a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii theory, and establish microcavity polaritons as a system for exploring the rich physics of non-equilibrium quantum fluids. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Completing an earlier work, the 'phase diagram' of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is presented. In the Benjamin-Feir stable region, spatiotemporal intermittency regimes are identified which consist of patches of linearly stable plane waves separated by localized objects with a well defined dynamics. The simplest of these structures are shown to be members of a family of exact solutions discovered by Nozaki and Bekki (1985). The problem of the determination of the parameter domain of existence of spatiotemporal intermittency is discussed. In particular, given the inadequacy of the quantities usually measured to determine spatiotemporal disorder, only a rather crude determination of the limit of spatiotemporal intermittency is proposed, awaiting further knowledge on the nature, stability and interactions of the localized objects involved. In the transition region, asymptotic states with an irregular, frozen spatial structure are shown to occur. Finally, the disordered regimes observed in the Benjamin-Feir unstable region are reviewed and argued to be of the spatiotemporal intermittency type in some cases. {\textcopyright} 1994 Russian Academy of Sciences and Turpion Ltd.},

@article{Shelykh2005,
abstract = {In this chapter we address a complex set of optical phenomena linked to the spin dynamics of exciton polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. When optically created, polaritons inherit the spin and dipole moment from the exciting light. Their state can be fully characterized by a so-called "pseudospin" accounting for both spin and dipole moment orientation. However, from the very beginning of their life in a microcavity, polaritons start changing their pseudospin state under effect of effective magnetic fields of different nature and due to scattering with acoustic phonons, defects, and other polaritons. This makes pseudospin dynamics of exciton polaritons rich and complex. It manifests itself in non-trivial changes in polarization of light emitted by the cavity versus time, pumping energy, pumping intensity and polarization. During the first years of theoretical research on exciton-polariton relaxation the polarization has been simply neglected. Later it has been understood that the energy and momentum-relaxation of exciton polaritons are spin-dependent. It is typically the case in the regime of stimulated scattering when the spin polarizations of initial and final polariton state have a huge effect on the scattering rate between these states. It appeared that critical conditions for polariton Bose-condensation are also polarization-dependent. In particular, the stimulation threshold (i.e. the pumping power needed to have a population exceeding 1 at the ground state of the lower polariton branch) has been experimentally shown to be lower under linear than under circular pumping. These experimental observations have stimulated the theoretical research toward understanding of mutually dependent polarization- and energy-relaxation mechanisms in microcavities. The authors of this chapter have been working on theoretical description of different specific effects of polariton spin-dynamics in microcavities for years. Here we attempted to put together all fragments and to formulate a general approach to the problem that would allow then to consider a variety of particular cases. We start from reminding the main spin-relaxation mechanisms known for free carriers and excitons. We then overview the most essential experimental results in this field before to present our original formalism which allowed us to interpret the key experimental findings. We are going to discuss only the strong coupling regime leaving aside all polarization effects in VCSELs. {\textcopyright} 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries.

Functional derivative techniques are found to help greatly in understanding the observed deviations from BCS laws. Approximate analytic formulas with simple correction factors for strong-coupling corrections embodied in the single parameter Tcln are also found to be very helpful. Here Tc is the critical temperature and ln is an average boson energy mediating the pairing potential in Eliashberg theory. In view of the discovery of high-Tc superconductivity in the copper oxides, results in the very strong coupling limit of Tcln1 are also considered, as is the asymptotic limit when Tcln. This case is of theoretical interest only, but it is nevertheless important because simple analytic results apply that give insight into the more realistic strong-coupling regime. A discussion more specific to the oxides is included in which it is concluded that some high-energy boson-exchange mechanism must be operative, with, possibly, some important phonon contribution in some cases. A more definitive application of boson-exchange models to the oxides awaits better experimental results. {\textcopyright} 1990 The American Physical Society.},

We consider a 2D planar cavity with two polarization eigenmodes, where the pseudospin measurement can be performed via polarization-resolved photoluminescence. We also consider the s band of a staggered honeycomb lattice with polarization-degenerate modes (scalar photons), where the sublattice pseudospin can be measured by performing spatially resolved interferometric measurements. We finally consider the s band of a honeycomb lattice with polarized (spinor) photons as an example of a four-band model. We simulate realistic experimental situations in all cases.

As an example of such magnetic texture we use a single magnetic dot with magnetization either perpendicular or parallel to the film.

abstract = {This article offers a comprehensive survey of results obtained for solitons and complex nonlinear wave patterns supported by nonlinear lattices (NLs), which represent a spatially periodic modulation of the local strength and sign of the nonlinearity, and their combinations with linear lattices. A majority of the results obtained, thus far, in this field and reviewed in this article are theoretical. Nevertheless, relevant experimental settings are also surveyed, with emphasis on perspectives for implementation of the theoretical predictions in the experiment. Physical systems discussed in the review belong to the realms of nonlinear optics (including artificial optical media, such as photonic crystals, and plasmonics) and Bose-Einstein condensation. The solitons are considered in one, two, and three dimensions. Basic properties of the solitons presented in the review are their existence, stability, and mobility. Although the field is still far from completion, general conclusions can be drawn. In particular, a novel fundamental property of one-dimensional solitons, which does not occur in the absence of NLs, is a finite threshold value of the soliton norm, necessary for their existence. In multidimensional settings, the stability of solitons supported by the spatial modulation of the nonlinearity is a truly challenging problem, for theoretical and experimental studies alike. In both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases, the mechanism that creates solitons in NLs in principle is different from its counterpart in linear lattices, as the solitons are created directly, rather than bifurcating from Bloch modes of linear lattices. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

The essence of this effect lies in the emergence of a drag electric current (and a spin current) due to a propagating surface acoustic wave. This current consists of three contributions, one independent of the valley index and proportional to the acoustic wave vector, the other arising due to the trigonal warping of the electron dispersion, and the third one is due to the Berry phase, which Bloch electrons acquire traveling along the crystal. As a result, there appear components of the current orthogonal to the acoustic wave vector. Further, we build an angular pattern, encompassing nontrivial topological properties of the acoustoelectric current, and suggest a way to run and measure the conventional diffusive, warping, and acoustoelectric valley Hall currents independently. We develop a theory, which opens a way to manipulate valley transport by acoustic methods, expanding the applicability of valleytronic effects on acoustoelectronic devices.},

Along with profound modifications of fundamental quantum optical effects giving rise to a rich phenomenology, this regime introduces significant theoretical challenges. One of the most important is the break-down of the rotating-wave approximation which neglects all non-resonant terms in light-matter interaction Hamiltonians. Consequently, a large part of the quantum optical theoretical framework has to be revisited in order to accurately account for all interaction terms in this regime. We give in this article a broad overview of the recent progress, ranging from analytical estimate of ground-state properties to proper derivations of master equations and computation of photodetection signals. For each aspect of the theory, the basic principles of the methods are illustrated on paradigmatic models such as quantum Rabi and spin-boson models. In this spirit, most of the article is devoted to effective models, relevant for the various experimental platforms in which the ultrastrong coupling has been reached, such as semiconductor microcavities and superconducting circuits. The validity of these models is discussed in the last part of the article, where we address recent debates on fundamental issues related to gauge invariance in the ultrastrong-coupling regime.},

abstract = {Controlling the way light interacts with material excitations is at the heart of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the strong-coupling regime, quantum emitters in a microresonator absorb and spontaneously re-emit a photon many times before dissipation becomes effective, giving rise to mixed light-matter eigenmodes. Recent experiments in semiconductor microcavities reached a new limit of ultrastrong coupling, where photon exchange occurs on timescales comparable to the oscillation period of light. In this limit, ultrafast modulation of the coupling strength has been suggested to lead to unconventional QED phenomena. Although sophisticated light-matter coupling has been achieved in all three spatial dimensions, control in the fourth dimension, time, is little developed. Here we use a quantum-well waveguide structure to optically tune light-matter interaction from weak to ultrastrong and turn on maximum coupling within less than one cycle of light. In this regime, a class of extremely non-adiabatic phenomena becomes observable. In particular, we directly monitor how a coherent photon population converts to cavity polaritons during abrupt switching. This system forms a promising laboratory in which to study novel sub-cycle QED effects and represents an efficient room-temperature switching device operating at unprecedented speed. {\textcopyright}2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Almost twenty years ago, light was slowed down to less than 10-7 of its vacuum speed in a cloud of ultracold atoms of sodium. Upon a sudden turn-off of the coupling laser, a slow light pulse can be imprinted on cold atoms such that it can be read out and converted into a photon again. In this process, the light is stopped by absorbing it and storing its shape within the atomic ensemble. Alternatively, the light can be stopped at the band edge in photonic-crystal waveguides, where the group speed vanishes. Here, we extend the phenomenon of stopped light to the new field of parity-time (PT) symmetric systems. We show that zero group speed in PT symmetric optical waveguides can be achieved if the system is prepared at an exceptional point, where two optical modes coalesce.

abstract = {We study non-Hermitian photonic lattices that exhibit competition between conservative and non-Hermitian (gain/loss) couplings. A bipartite sublattice symmetry enforces the existence of non-Hermitian flat bands, which are typically embedded in an auxiliary dispersive band and give rise to nondiffracting "compact localized states". Band crossings take the form of non-Hermitian degeneracies known as exceptional points. Excitations of the lattice can produce either diffracting or amplifying behaviors. If the non-Hermitian coupling is fine-tuned to generate an effective $\pi$ flux, the lattice spectrum becomes completely flat, a non-Hermitian analog of Aharonov-Bohm caging in which the magnetic field is replaced by balanced gain and loss. When the effective flux is zero, the non-Hermitian band crossing points give rise to asymmetric diffraction and anomalous linear amplification.},

abstract = {A remarkable analogy is established between the well-known spin Hall effect and the polarization dependence of Rayleigh scattering of light in microcavities. This dependence results from the strong spin effect in elastic scattering of exciton polaritons: if the initial polariton state has a zero spin and is characterized by some linear polarization, the scattered polaritons become strongly spin polarized. The polarization in the scattered state can be positive or negative dependent on the orientation of the linear polarization of the initial state and on the direction of scattering. Very surprisingly, spin polarizations of the polaritons scattered clockwise and anticlockwise have different signs. The optical spin Hall effect is possible due to strong longitudinal-transverse splitting and finite lifetime of exciton polaritons in microcavities. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in many areas of physics, including cosmology, particle physics and condensed matter. An example is the breaking of spatial translational symmetry, which underlies the formation of crystals and the phase transition from liquid to solid. Using the analogy of crystals in space, the breaking of translational symmetry in time and the emergence of a 'time crystal' was recently proposed, but was later shown to be forbidden in thermal equilibrium. However, non-equilibrium Floquet systems, which are subject to a periodic drive, can exhibit persistent time correlations at an emergent subharmonic frequency. This new phase of matter has been dubbed a 'discrete time crystal'. Here we present the experimental observation of a discrete time crystal, in an interacting spin chain of trapped atomic ions. We apply a periodic Hamiltonian to the system under many-body localization conditions, and observe a subharmonic temporal response that is robust to external perturbations. The observation of such a time crystal opens the door to the study of systems with long-range spatio-temporal correlations and novel phases of matter that emerge under intrinsically non-equilibrium conditions.},

Spontaneous coherence of matter waves forms the basis of a number of fundamental phenomena in physics, including superconductivity, superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation. Spontaneous coherence is the key characteristic of condensation in momentum space. Excitons-bound pairs of electrons and holes-form a model system to explore the quantum physics of cold bosons in solids. Cold exciton gases can be realized in a system of indirect excitons, which can cool down below the temperature of quantum degeneracy owing to their long lifetimes. Here we report measurements of spontaneous coherence in a gas of indirect excitons. We found that spontaneous coherence of excitons emerges in the region of the macroscopically ordered exciton state and in the region of vortices of linear polarization. The coherence length in these regions is much larger than in a classical gas, indicating a coherent state with a much narrower than classical exciton distribution in momentum space, characteristic of a condensate. A pattern of extended spontaneous coherence is correlated with a pattern of spontaneous polarization, revealing the properties of a multicomponent coherent state. We also observed phase singularities in the coherent exciton gas. All these phenomena emerge when the exciton gas is cooled below a few kelvin. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {We study the bulk-phonon-scattering contribution to the transport properties of a two-dimensional electron gas formed at the interface of an ultrapure AlxGa1-xAs/GaAs heterojunction. Assuming that the electrons only occupy the lowest subband, we calculate the mobility as a function of temperature for the temperature range T=1"300 K, within the variational-subband- wave-function model for carrier confinement. Our work encompasses three physically distinct temperature ranges with respect to phonon scattering: the Block-Gr̈neisen (BG), equipartition (EP), and inelastic regimes. In the EP regime we calculate (i) the individual and total scattering rates as-1, and momentum relaxation rates at-1, due to deformation-potential and piezoelectric coupled acoustic-mode phonons, with screening of these rates taken into account within the static random-phase approximation; (ii) the acoustic-phonon- scattering limited drift mobilities 1/4ac for different densities ns as a function of temperature T; (iii) the level of validity of Matthiessens rule; and (iv) the dimensionless Hall ratio rH. In addition, we investigate in detail the temperature dependence of the low-temperature mobility and find excellent agreement with experimental data for the linear coefficient ±=d1/4-1(T)/ dT of the temperature dependence as a function of density. We carry out similar calculations in the BG regime and compare the results with the corresponding ones in the EP regime. Finally, to evaluate the mobility in the inelastic regime at high temperatures above T40 K, where the scattering from polar LO phonons becomes important, we compute the first-order perturbation distribution (E) as a function of the carrier energy E by directly solving the linearized Boltzmann equation by an iterative method. We compare these results with the commonly used closed-form approximations for : the low-temperature relaxation-time approximation aLT, and the high-energy relaxation-time approximation aHE, and check their level of validity. {\textcopyright} 1992 The American Physical Society.},

We also show that this edge-centered square lattice can host intriguing topologically nontrivial phases when intrinsic spin-orbit (ISO) coupling is introduced in the microscopic description of the corresponding tight-binding Hamiltonian of the system. This ISO coupling strength acts like a complex next-nearest-neighbor hopping term for this model and can be, in principle, tuned in a real-life experimental setup. In the presence of this ISO coupling, the band spectrum of the system gets gapped out, leading to nonzero integer values of the spin Chern number for different bands, indicating the nontrivial topological properties of the system. Furthermore, we show that for certain values of the ISO coupling, nearly flat bands with nonzero Chern numbers emerge in this lattice model. This opens up the possibility of realizing interesting fractional quantum spin Hall physics in this model when interaction is taken into account. This study might be very useful in an analogous optical lattice experimental setup. A possible application of our results can also be anticipated in the field of photonics using single-mode photonic waveguide networks.},

In this Letter we use a family of interactions tuned to two-body unitarity and very weak three-body binding to demonstrate the universal properties of both clusters and matter. We determine the universal properties of finite clusters up to 60 particles and, for the first time, explicitly demonstrate the saturation of energy and density with particle number and compare with bulk properties. At saturation in the bulk we determine the energy, density, two- and three-body contacts, and the condensate fraction. We find that uniform matter is more bound than three-body clusters by nearly 2 orders of magnitude, the two-body contact is very large in absolute terms, and yet the condensate fraction is also very large, greater than 90{\%}. Equilibrium properties of these systems may be experimentally accessible through rapid quenching of weakly interacting boson superfluids.},

abstract = {A broad review of fundamental electronic properties of two-dimensional graphene with the emphasis on density and temperature-dependent carrier transport in doped or gated graphene structures is provided. A salient feature of this review is a critical comparison between carrier transport in graphene and in two-dimensional semiconductor systems (e.g., heterostructures, quantum wells, inversion layers) so that the unique features of graphene electronic properties arising from its gapless, massless, chiral Dirac spectrum are highlighted. Experiment and theory, as well as quantum and semiclassical transport, are discussed in a synergistic manner in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective. Although the emphasis of the review is on those aspects of graphene transport where reasonable consensus exists in the literature, open questions are discussed as well. Various physical mechanisms controlling transport are described in depth including long-range charged impurity scattering, screening, short-range defect scattering, phonon scattering, many-body effects, Klein tunneling, minimum conductivity at the Dirac point, electron-hole puddle formation, p-n junctions, localization, percolation, quantum-classical crossover, midgap states, quantum Hall effects, and other phenomena. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

In this Letter, we study the acoustic version of valley states in sonic crystals and reveal a vortex nature of such states. In addition to the selection rules established for exciting valley polarized states, a mimicked valley Hall effect of sound is proposed further. The extraordinary chirality of valley vortex states, detectable in experiments, may open a new possibility in sound manipulations. This is appealing to scalar acoustics that lacks a spin degree of freedom inherently. In addition, the valley selection enables a handy way to create vortex matter in acoustics, in which the vortex chirality can be controlled flexibly. Potential applications can be anticipated with the exotic interaction of acoustic vortices with matter, such as to trigger the rotation of the trapped microparticles without contact.},

Metal-based approaches are of particular interest in this field, as they carry the potential to squeeze optical modes to spaces significantly below the diffraction limit. Transition metal dichalcogenides are ideally suited as the active material in cavity quantum electrodynamics, as they interact strongly with light at the ultimate monolayer limit. Here, we implement a Tamm-plasmon-polariton structure and study the coupling to a monolayer of WSe2, hosting highly stable excitons. Exciton-polariton formation at room temperature is manifested in the characteristic energy-momentum dispersion relation studied in photoluminescence, featuring an anti-crossing between the exciton and photon modes with a Rabi-splitting of 23.5 meV. Creating polaritonic quasiparticles in monolithic, compact architectures with atomic monolayers under ambient conditions is a crucial step towards the exploration of nonlinearities, macroscopic coherence and advanced spinor physics with novel, low-mass bosons.},

abstract = {We introduce an alternative scheme for creating topological polaritons (topolaritons) by exploiting the presence of photonic Dirac cones in photonic crystals with triangular lattice symmetry. As recently proposed, topolariton states can emerge from a coupling between photons and excitons combined with a periodic exciton potential and a magnetic field to open up a topological gap. We show that in photonic crystals the opening of the gap can be substantially simplified close to photonic Dirac points. Coupling to Zeeman-split excitons breaks time reversal symmetry and allows to gap out the Dirac cones in a nontrival way, leading to a topological gap similar to the strength of the periodic exciton potential. Compared to the original topolariton proposal [T. Karzig, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031001 (2015)10.1103/PhysRevX.5.031001], this scheme significantly increases the size of the topological gap over a wide range of parameters.

For the last approach in particular, we show the simplest lattice structure where it can be applied, and we further identify a special case of such a flat band where every point in the Brillouin zone is an exceptional point of order 3. A localized excitation in this "EP3 flat band" can display either a conserved power, quadratic power increase, or even quartic power increase, depending on whether the localized eigenstate or one of the two generalized eigenvectors is initially excited.

One of the most intriguing extensions of such a light-matter interaction is the so-called ultrastrong coupling regime. It is achieved when the Rabi frequency ($\Omega$R, the energy exchange rate between the emitter and the resonant photonic mode) reaches a considerable fraction of the emitter transition frequency, $\omega$0. Here, we report a Rabi energy splitting (2ℏ$\Omega$R) of 1.12 eV and record values of the coupling ratio (2$\Omega$R/$\omega$0) up to 0.6-fold the material band gap in organic semiconductor microcavities and up to 0.5-fold in monolithic heterostructure organic light-emitting diodes working at room temperature. Furthermore, we show that with such a large coupling strength it is possible to undress the exciton homogeneous linewidth from its inhomogeneous broadening, which allows for an unprecedented narrow emission line (below the cavity finesse) for such organic LEDs. The latter can be exploited for the realization of novel monochromatic sources and near-IR organic emitting devices. (Graph Presented).},

abstract = {The problem of the two-photon coherent generation of entanglement photon pairs in quantum optics has been intensively studied over the passing years. It is important to note that the two-quanta cooperative effects also play a main role in other fields of physics. One example is superconductivity, where the Cooper pairs are created due to the simultaneous two-phonon exchange between electrons. It occurs when the one-phonon exchange integral between the band electrons is smaller than that of the two-phonon exchange. This is possible in many-band superconducting materials, in which the two-phonon exchange integral arises through the virtual bands of the material. Some estimates of the two-phonon superconductivity have already been given. A more realistic model which takes into account the specificities of the many-band aspects of superconductor materials will be proposed. In two-phonon processes, a more complicated temperature dependence on the order parameter is expected. A rigorous study of this anomalous temperature dependence on the order parameter of superconductors is presented. One expects that the two-phonon exchange effects can amplify the superconductivity in a way similar to the way the thermal field amplifies the two-photon super-radiance in a microcavity.},

abstract = {Topological insulators—materials that are insulating in the bulk but allow electrons to flow on their surface—are striking examples of materials in which topological invariants are manifested in robustness against perturbations such as defects and disorder1. Their most prominent feature is the emergence of edge states at the boundary between areas with different topological properties. The observable physical effect is unidirectional robust transport of these edge states. Topological insulators were originally observed in the integer quantum Hall effect2 (in which conductance is quantized in a strong magnetic field) and subsequently suggested3–5 and observed6 to exist without a magnetic field, by virtue of other effects such as strong spin–orbit interaction. These were systems of correlated electrons. During the past decade, the concepts of topological physics have been introduced into other fields, including microwaves7,8, photonic systems9,10, cold atoms11,12, acoustics13,14 and even mechanics15. Recently, topological insulators were suggested to be possible in exciton-polariton systems16–18 organized as honeycomb (graphene-like) lattices, under the influence of a magnetic field. Exciton-polaritons are part-light, part-matter quasiparticles that emerge from strong coupling of quantum-well excitons and cavity photons19. Accordingly, the predicted topological effects differ from all those demonstrated thus far. Here we demonstrate experimentally an exciton-polariton topological insulator. Our lattice of coupled semiconductor microcavities is excited non-resonantly by a laser, and an applied magnetic field leads to the unidirectional flow of a polariton wavepacket around the edge of the array. This chiral edge mode is populated by a polariton condensation mechanism. We use scanning imaging techniques in real space and Fourier space to measure photoluminescence and thus visualize the mode as it propagates. We demonstrate that the topological edge mode goes around defects, and that its propagation direction can be reversed by inverting the applied magnetic field. Our exciton-polariton topological insulator paves the way for topological phenomena that involve light–matter interaction, amplification and the interaction of exciton-polaritons as a nonlinear many-body system.},

Disorder in the external magnetic field does not impact localization. Disorder in all the remaining angles yields Anderson localization.

abstract = {Practical challenges to extrapolating Moore's law favour alternatives to electrons as information carriers. Two promising candidates are spin-based and all-optical architectures, the former offering lower energy consumption, the latter superior signal transfer down to the level of chip-interconnects. Polaritons - spinor quasi-particles composed of semiconductor excitons and microcavity photons - directly couple exciton spins and photon polarizations, combining the advantages of both approaches. However, their implementation for spintronics has been hindered because polariton spins can be manipulated only optically or by strong magnetic fields. Here we use an external electric field to directly control the spin of a polariton condensate, bias-tuning the emission polarization. The nonlinear spin dynamics offers an alternative route to switching, allowing us to realize an electrical spin-switch exhibiting ultralow switching energies below 0.5 fJ. Our results lay the foundation for development of devices based on the electro-optical control of coherent spin ensembles on a chip.},

In the vicinity of polariton lasing threshold we then develop a nonlinear mean-field model accounting for interactions and gain saturation, and identify several bifurcation scenarios leading to formation of high angular momentum quantum vortices. For experimentally relevant parameters we predict the emergence of spatially and temporally ordered polariton condensates (time crystals), which can be witnessed by frequency combs in the polariton lasing spectrum or by direct time-resolved optical emission measurements.

The interaction plays a crucial role in the appearance of topological bound states and the system becomes completely trivial if the interaction is switched off.

abstract = {The vast majority of real-life optimization problems with a large number of degrees of freedom are intractable by classical computers, since their complexity grows exponentially fast with the number of variables. Many of these problems can be mapped into classical spin models, such as the Ising, the XY or the Heisenberg models, so that optimization problems are reduced to finding the global minimum of spin models. Here, we propose and investigate the potential of polariton graphs as an efficient analogue simulator for finding the global minimum of the XY model. By imprinting polariton condensate lattices of bespoke geometries we show that we can engineer various coupling strengths between the lattice sites and read out the result of the global minimization through the relative phases. Besides solving optimization problems, polariton graphs can simulate a large variety of systems undergoing the U(1) symmetry-breaking transition. We realize various magnetic phases, such as ferromagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, and frustrated spin configurations on a linear chain, the unit cells of square and triangular lattices, a disordered graph, and demonstrate the potential for size scalability on an extended square lattice of 45 coherently coupled polariton condensates. Our results provide a route to study unconventional superfluids, spin liquids, Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless phase transition, and classical magnetism, among the many systems that are described by the XY Hamiltonian.},

Above the threshold, the emission is instead phase coherent over the whole two-dimensional sample and intensity fluctuations are suppressed.

abstract = {On a large class of lattices (such as the sawtooth chain, the kagome and the pyrochlore lattices), the quantum Heisenberg and the repulsive Hubbard models may host a completely dispersionless (flat) energy band in the single-particle spectrum. The flat-band states can be viewed as completely localized within a finite volume (trap) of the lattice and allow for construction of many-particle states, roughly speaking, by occupying the traps with particles. If the flat-band happens to be the lowest-energy one, the manifold of such many-body states will often determine the ground-state and low-temperature physics of the models at hand even in the presence of strong interactions. The localized nature of these many-body states makes possible the mapping of this subset of eigenstates onto a corresponding classical hard-core system. As a result, the ground-state and low-temperature properties of the strongly correlated flat-band systems can be analyzed in detail using concepts and tools of classical statistical mechanics (e.g., classical lattice-gas approach or percolation approach), in contrast to more challenging quantum many-body techniques usually necessary to examine strongly correlated quantum systems. In this review, we recapitulate the basic features of the flat-band spin systems and briefly summarize earlier studies in the field. The main emphasis is made on recent developments which include results for both spin and electron flat-band models. In particular, for flat-band spin systems, we highlight field-driven phase transitions for frustrated quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets at low temperatures, chiral flat-band states, as well as the effect of a slight dispersion of a previously strictly flat-band due to nonideal lattice geometry. For electronic systems, we discuss the universal low-temperature behavior of several flat-band Hubbard models, the emergence of ground-state ferromagnetism in the square-lattice Tasaki-Hubbard model and the related Pauli-correlated percolation problem, as well as the dispersion-driven ground-state ferromagnetism in flat-band Hubbard systems. Closely related studies and possible experimental realizations of the flat-band physics are also described briefly.},

As the conduction- and valence-band edges are predominantly contributed by the dz2, dxy, and d x2-y2 orbitals of M atoms, the TB model is constructed using these three orbitals based on the symmetries of the monolayers. Parameters of the TB model are fitted from the first-principles energy bands for all MX2 monolayers. The TB model involving only the nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings is sufficient to capture the band-edge properties in the ±K valleys, including the energy dispersions as well as the Berry curvatures. The TB model involving up to the third-nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings can well reproduce the energy bands in the entire Brillouin zone. Spin-orbit coupling in valence bands is well accounted for by including the on-site spin-orbit interactions of M atoms. The conduction band also exhibits a small valley-dependent spin splitting which has an overall sign difference between MoX2 and WX 2. We discuss the origins of these corrections to the three-band model. The three-band TB model developed here is efficient to account for low-energy physics in MX2 monolayers, and its simplicity can be particularly useful in the study of many-body physics and physics of edge states. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

In this work, we report on a strong coupling regime between excitons in monolayer WSe2 and photons confined in an open, voltage-tunable dielectric microcavity. The tunability of our system allows us to extend the exciton-polariton state over a wide energy range and, in particular, to bring the excitonic component of the lower polariton mode into resonance with other excitonic transitions in monolayer WSe2. We can retain up to 40{\%} of initial circular polarization of the laser or loose it completely if polariton modes are brought into resonances with low energy excitonic modes.},

We exemplify this generic, disorder-induced decay mechanism at the cross-stitch lattice.

abstract = {Modern nanotechnology allows one to scale down various important devices (sensors, chips, fibers, etc.) and thus opens up new horizons for their applications. The efficiency of most of them is based on fundamental physical phenomena, such as transport of wave excitations and resonances. Short propagation distances make phase-coherent processes of waves important. Often the scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths and, as a consequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference corresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant suppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and theoretical work has revealed such patterns in different physical settings. The purpose of this review is to relate resonant scattering to Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of the main features of the Fano resonance is its asymmetric line profile. The asymmetry originates from a close coexistence of resonant transmission and resonant reflection and can be reduced to the interaction of a discrete (localized) state with a continuum of propagation modes. The basic concepts of Fano resonances are introduced, their geometrical and/or dynamical origin are explained, and theoretical and experimental studies of light propagation in photonic devices, charge transport through quantum dots, plasmon scattering in Josephson-junction networks, and matter-wave scattering in ultracold atom systems, among others are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Motivated by this result, here we investigate the weak-coupling thermodynamics of Eliashberg theory, with a central focus on the free energy, specific heat, and the critical magnetic field. In particular, we numerically calculate the difference between the superconducting and normal-state specific heats, and we find that this quantity differs from its BCS counterpart by a factor of {\$}1/\backslashsqrt{\{}e{\}}{\$}, for all temperatures below {\$}T{\_}{\{}c{\}}{\$}.

By using the Kronig-Penney model, the condensate and Bogoliubov bands are analytically calculated and the stability of condensates in a periodic potential is discussed. The Landau and dynamical instabilities occur in a Kronig-Penney potential when the quasimomentum of the condensate exceeds certain critical values as in a sinusoidal potential. It is found that the onsets of the Landau and dynamical instabilities coincide with the point where the perfect transmission of low energy excitations through each potential barrier is forbidden. The Landau instability is caused by the excitations with small q and the dynamical instability is caused by the excitations with q=$\pi$a at their onsets, where q is the quasimomentum of excitation and a is the lattice constant. A swallow-tail energy loop appears at the edge of the first condensate band when the mean-field energy is sufficiently larger than the strength of the periodic potential. We find that the upper portion of the swallow-tail is always dynamically unstable, but the second Bogoliubov band has a phonon spectrum reflecting the positive effective mass. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

This nonintegrable system exhibits two different symmetries: a permutational symmetry and another one related to the reversal of the total momentum of the system. Each of these symmetries is responsible for the existence of two kinds of quasidegenerate states. At sufficiently high energy, pairs of symmetry-related states glue together to form quadruplets. We show that, starting from the anticontinuous limit, particular quadruplets allow us to construct quantum states whose properties are very similar to those of classical rotobreathers. Contrary to the classical situation, the coupling between pendulums necessarily introduces a periodic exchange of energy between them at a frequency which is proportional to the energy splitting between quasidegenerate states related to the permutation symmetry. This splitting may remain very small as the coupling strength increases and is a decreasing function of the pair energy. The energy may be therefore stored in one pendulum during a time period very long as compared to the inverse of the internal rotobreather frequency. {\textcopyright} 2002 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Among two-dimensional lattices, both kagome and Lieb lattices have been extensively studied, showing unique physics related to their exotic flat and Dirac bands. Interestingly, we realize that the two lattices are in fact interconvertible by applying strains along the diagonal direction, as they share the same structural configuration in the unit cell, i.e., one corner-site and two edge-center states. We study phase transitions between the two lattices using the tight-binding approach and propose one experimental realization of the transitions using photonic devices. The evolution of the band structure demonstrates a continuous evolution of the flat band from the middle of the Lieb band to the top/bottom of the kagome band. Though the flat band is destroyed during the transition, the topological features are conserved due to the retained inversion symmetry, as confirmed by Berry curvature, Wannier charge center, and edge state calculations. Meanwhile, the triply degenerate Dirac point (M) in the Lieb lattice transforms into two doubly degenerate Dirac points, one of which moves along M-$\Gamma$ and the other moves along M-K/K′ directions that form the kagome band eventually. Interestingly, the Dirac cones in the transition states are strongly tilted, showing a coexistence of type-I and type-II Dirac points. We finally show that these transitions can be experimentally realized in photonic lattices using waveguide arrays.},

The so-called ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime is established when the light-matter interaction energy is a comparable fraction of the bare frequencies of the uncoupled systems. Furthermore, when the interaction strengths become larger than the bare frequencies, the deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime emerges. This article reviews advances in the field of the USC and DSC regimes, in particular, for light modes confined in cavities interacting with two-level systems. An overview is first provided on the theoretical progress since the origins from the semiclassical Rabi model until recent developments of the quantum Rabi model. Next, several key experimental results from a variety of quantum platforms are described, including superconducting circuits, semiconductor quantum wells, and other hybrid quantum systems. Finally, anticipated applications are highlighted utilizing USC and DSC regimes, including novel quantum optical phenomena, quantum simulation, and quantum computation.},

We study the dynamics of this system under the action of a weak alternating external electromagnetic field in the presence of a uniform magnetic field, perpendicular to the layers. We reveal that the electromagnetic power absorption exhibits a double-resonance spectrum. We show that the first resonance is associated with the conventional well-studied magnetoplasmon excitations of the electron gas and it has a standard Lorentzian shape, whereas the second resonance is a peculiarity attributed to the Bose-condensed exciton gas. Further, we explicitly demonstrate that the spectrum of the system exhibits an asymmetric Fano-type profile, where the excitonic peak is extremely narrow in comparison with the magnetoplasmon one. We show that the shape of the resonance and the position of the peaks depend on the magnitude of the applied magnetic field, exciton-condensate density, and exciton-impurity scattering time. In particular, the Fano profile turns into a Lorentzian shape with decreasing exciton-impurity scattering time and the position of the plasmon-associated resonance is mainly sensitive and determined by the magnetic field strength, whereas the exciton-condensate peak position is determined by the exciton-condensate density. It opens the experimental possibility to determine the latter quantity in cyclotron resonance experiments.},

The simultaneously acting polariton-phonon scattering increases the number of condensed particles considerably by providing a heat dissipation from the polariton gas to the lattice. For nonresonant excitations at large k values the considered scattering mechanisms cannot support a polariton condensation. Above (below) laser threshold there exists a (no) polariton condensate and the polariton distribution of the noncondensed particles can be fitted by a Bose-Einstein (Maxwell-Boltzmann) distribution.

These capabilities are at the core of lightwave electronics - the dream of ultrafast lightwave control over electron dynamics in solids, on a few-cycle to sub-cycle timescale, aiming at information processing at tera-Hertz to peta-Hertz rates. Here we show a robust and general approach to valley-selective electron excitations in two-dimensional solids, by controlling the sub-cycle structure of non-resonant driving fields at a few-femtosecond timescale. Bringing the frequency-domain concept of topological Floquet systems to the few-fsec time domain, we develop a transparent control mechanism in real space and an all-optical, non-element-specific method to coherently write, manipulate and read selective valley excitations using fields carried in a wide range of frequencies, on timescales that can be much shorter than the valley lifetime, crucial for implementation of valleytronic devices.},

Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g., condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins, and photons have been proposed as quantum simulators.

First observed in liquid 4 He, this phenomenon has been intensively studied in a variety of systems for its remarkable features such as the persistence of superflows and the proliferation of quantized vortices. The achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases provided the opportunity to observe and study superfluidity in an extremely clean and well-controlled environment. In the solid state, Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton polaritons has been reported recently. Polaritons are strongly interacting light-matter quasiparticles that occur naturally in semiconductor microcavities in the strong-coupling regime and constitute an interesting example of composite bosons. Here, we report the observation of spontaneous formation of pinned quantized vortices in the Bose-condensed phase of a polariton fluid. Theoretical insight into the possible origin of such vortices is presented in terms of a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Whereas the observation of quantized vortices is, in itself, not sufficient for establishing the superfluid nature of the non-equilibrium polariton condensate, it suggests parallels between our system and conventional superfluids. {\textcopyright} 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We derive a nondivergent scattering lifetime for finite thickness structures, which can be used both with lowest order perturbation theory and the multiple scattering theory. We calculate the quantum and transport lifetimes for electrons in generic GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures and find that the correct "rule of thumb" to distinguish the dominant scattering mechanisms in GaAs heterostructures should be $\tau$t / $\tau$q 10 for background impurities and $\tau$t / $\tau$q 10 for remote impurities. Finally we compare theoretical results for $\tau$q and $\tau$t with experimental data from a GaAs 2DEG in which only background impurity scattering is present.

abstract = {The celebrated work of Niu, Thouless, and Wu demonstrated the quantization of Hall conductance in the presence of many-body interactions by revealing the many-body counterpart of the Chern number. The generalized Chern number is formulated in terms of the twisted angles of the boundary condition, instead of the single particle momentum, and involves an integration over all possible twisted angles. However, this formulation is physically unnatural, since topological invariants directly related to observables should be defined for each Hamiltonian under a fixed boundary condition. In this work, we show via numerical calculations that the integration is indeed unnecessary - the integrand itself is effectively quantized and the error decays exponentially with the system size. This implies that the numerical cost in computing the many-body Chern number could, in principle, be significantly reduced as it suffices to compute the Berry connection for a single value of the twisted boundary condition if the system size is sufficiently large.},

Here we show that higher-order topological corner states can emerge by introducing staggered on-site gain and loss to a Hermitian system in a trivial phase. For such a non-Hermitian system, we establish a general bulk-corner correspondence by developing a biorthogonal nested-Wilson-loop and edge-polarization theory, which can be applied to a wide class of non-Hermitian systems with higher-order topological orders. The theory gives rise to topological invariants characterizing the non-Hermitian topological multipole moments (i.e., corner states) that are protected by reflection or chiral symmetry. Such gain- and loss-induced higher-order topological corner states can be experimentally realized using photons in coupled cavities or cold atoms in optical lattices.},

We study the properties of single-and double-well potentials, and find the quality of structuring sufficient for thermalization and Bose-Einstein condensation of light. The investigation of effective photon-photon interactions along with the observed tunnel coupling between sites makes the system a promising candidate to directly populate entangled photonic many-body states.

abstract = {Quantum systems out of equilibrium are presently a subject of active research, both in theoretical and experimental domains. In this work, we consider time-periodically modulated quantum systems that are in contact with a stationary environment. Within the framework of a quantum master equation, the asymptotic states of such systems are described by time-periodic density operators. Resolution of these operators constitutes a nontrivial computational task. Approaches based on spectral and iterative methods are restricted to systems with the dimension of the hosting Hilbert space dimH=N 300, while the direct long-time numerical integration of the master equation becomes increasingly problematic for N 400, especially when the coupling to the environment is weak. To go beyond this limit, we use the quantum trajectory method, which unravels the master equation for the density operator into a set of stochastic processes for wave functions. The asymptotic density matrix is calculated by performing a statistical sampling over the ensemble of quantum trajectories, preceded by a long transient propagation. We follow the ideology of event-driven programming and construct a new algorithmic realization of the method. The algorithm is computationally efficient, allowing for long "leaps" forward in time. It is also numerically exact, in the sense that, being given the list of uniformly distributed (on the unit interval) random numbers, {\{}$\eta$1,$\eta$2,⋯,$\eta$n{\}}, one could propagate a quantum trajectory (with $\eta$i's as norm thresholds) in a numerically exact way. By using a scalable N-particle quantum model, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows us to resolve the asymptotic density operator of the model system with N=2000 states on a regular-size computer cluster, thus reaching the scale on which numerical studies of modulated Hamiltonian systems are currently performed.},

abstract = {Atomically thin materials such as graphene and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit remarkable physical properties resulting from their reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetry. The family of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides is an especially promising platform for fundamental studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems, with potential applications in optoelectronics and valleytronics due to their direct band gap in the monolayer limit and highly efficient light-matter coupling. A crystal lattice with broken inversion symmetry combined with strong spin-orbit interactions leads to a unique combination of the spin and valley degrees of freedom. In addition, the 2D character of the monolayers and weak dielectric screening from the environment yield a significant enhancement of the Coulomb interaction. The resulting formation of bound electron-hole pairs, or excitons, dominates the optical and spin properties of the material. Here recent progress in understanding of the excitonic properties in monolayer TMDs is reviewed and future challenges are laid out. Discussed are the consequences of the strong direct and exchange Coulomb interaction, exciton light-matter coupling, and influence of finite carrier and electron-hole pair densities on the exciton properties in TMDs. Finally, the impact on valley polarization is described and the tuning of the energies and polarization observed in applied electric and magnetic fields is summarized.},

abstract = {Bosons with finite lifetime exhibit condensation and lasing when their influx exceeds the lasing threshold determined by the dissipative losses. In general, different one-particle states decay differently, and the bosons are usually assumed to condense in the state with the longest lifetime. Interaction between the bosons partially neglected by such an assumption can smear the lasing threshold into a threshold domain-a stable lasing manybody state exists within certain intervals of the bosonic influxes. This recently described weak lasing regime is formed by the spontaneously symmetry breaking and phase-locking self-organization of bosonic modes, which results in an essentially manybody state with a stable balance between gains and losses. Here we report, to our knowledge, the first observation of the weak lasing phase in a one-dimensional condensate of exciton-polaritons subject to a periodic potential. Real and reciprocal space photoluminescence images demonstrate that the spatial period of the condensate is twice as large as the period of the underlying periodic potential. These experiments are realized at room temperature in a ZnO microwire deposited on a silicon grating. The period doubling takes place at a critical pumping power, whereas at a lower power polariton emission images have the same periodicity as the grating.},

Lasing is measured from a transition-metal dichalcogenide heterobilayer (WSe2–MoSe2) integrated in a silicon nitride grating resonator. An abrupt increase in the spatial coherence of the emission is observed across the lasing threshold. The work establishes interlayer excitons in two-dimensional heterostructures as a gain medium with spatially coherent lasing emission and potential for heterogeneous integration. With electrically tunable exciton–photon interaction strengths5 and long-range dipolar interactions, these interlayer excitons are promising for application as low-power, ultrafast lasers and modulators and for the study of many-body quantum phenomena6.},

While several properties unique to non-Hermitian topological systems were uncovered, the fundamental role of symmetry in non-Hermitian physics has yet to be fully understood, and it has remained unclear how symmetry protects non-Hermitian topological phases. Here we show that two fundamental anti-unitary symmetries, time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries, are topologically equivalent in the complex energy plane and hence unified in non-Hermitian physics. A striking consequence of this symmetry unification is the emergence of unique non-equilibrium topological phases that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. We illustrate this by presenting a non-Hermitian counterpart of the Majorana chain in an insulator with time-reversal symmetry and that of the quantum spin Hall insulator in a superconductor with particle-hole symmetry. Our work establishes a fundamental symmetry principle in non-Hermitian physics and paves the way towards a unified framework for non-equilibrium topological phases.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 American Physical Society. An exciton-polariton condensate loaded in a single active miniband in a one-dimensional microcavity wire with a complex-valued periodic potential changes its state with an increase of the polariton-polariton repulsion. This effect depends on the type of the single-particle dispersion of the miniband, which can be fine tuned by the real and imaginary components of the potential. As a result, the condensate can be formed in a zero state, $\pi$ state, or mixed state of spatiotemporal intermittency, depending on the shape of the miniband, strength of interparticle interaction, and distribution of gain in the system. The change of the condensate wave function with increasing interaction takes place by proliferation of dark solitons, which are the building blocks of the new condensate phase. We show that, in general, the interacting polaritons are not condensed in the state with minimal losses, nor do they accumulate in the state with a well-defined wave vector.},

They have become a unique testbed for generating and manipulating quantum vortices in a driven-dissipative superfluid. Here, we generate an exciton-polariton condensate with a nonresonant Laguerre-Gaussian optical beam and verify the direct transfer of light's orbital angular momentum to an exciton-polariton quantum fluid. Quantized vortices are found in spite of the large energy relaxation involved in nonresonant pumping. We identified phase singularity, density distribution, and energy eigenstates for the vortex states. Our observations confirm that nonresonant optical Laguerre-Gaussian beam can be used to manipulate chirality, topological charge, and stability of the nonequilibrium quantum fluid. These vortices are quite robust, only sensitive to the orbital angular momentum of light and not other parameters such as energy, intensity, size, or shape of the pump beam. Therefore, optical information can be transferred between the photon and exciton-polariton with ease and the technique is potentially useful to form the controllable network of multiple topological charges even in the presence of spectral randomness in a solid state system.},

Floquet topological insulators represent one of the possible venues for engineering topological phases, yet they have been so far largely restricted to temporal modulation of Hermitian potentials. On the other hand, in many physical systems, including acoustic and optical systems, modulating loss or gain can be more straightforwardly achieved. On the other hand, non-Hermitian Floquet potentials have not been shown to yield any novel topological phases to date. It is therefore of great interest to explore time-modulated non-Hermitian potentials in periodic lattices, and the emergence of topological phases associated with them. Here we demonstrate that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can indeed result in topological phases supporting nonreciprocal edge states propagating without dissipation, as well as regimes of dissipative and amplifying topological edge transport.},

abstract = {An analytical model of a prestressed concrete reactor vessel (PCRV) for LMFBR and the associated finite element com- puter code, involving an explicit time integration procedure, is described. The model is axisymmetric and includes simula- tions of the tensile cracking of concrete, the reinforcement, and a prestressing capability. The tensile cracking of concrete and the steel reinforcement are both modeled as continuously distr{\~{}}uted within the finite element. The stresses in the rein- forcement and concrete are computed separately and combined to give an overall stress state of the composite material. The reinformcement is assumed to be elastic, perfectly-plastic; the concrete is taken to be elastic, with tensile and com- pressive stress limits. Cracking of concrete is based on the criterion of maximum principal stress; a crack is assumed to form normal to the direction of the maximum principal stress. Attention is also given to the fact that cracks do not form instan- taneously, but develop gradually. Thus, after crack initiation the normal stress is reduced to zero gradually as a function of time. Residual shear resistance of cracks due to aggregate interlock is also taken into account. An existing crack is permitted to close. Prestressing of the PCRV is modeled by special structural members which represent an averaged prestressing layer equivalent to an axisymmetric shell. The internal prestressing members are superimposed over the reinforced concrete body of the PCRV; they are permitted to stretch and slide in a predetermined path, simulating the actual tendons. The validity of the code is examined by comparison with experimental data. Both static and dynamic data are com- pared with code predictions, and the agreement is satisfactory. A preliminary design has been developed for both pool and loop-type PCRVs. The code was applied to the analysis of these designs. This analysis reveals that the critical locations in such a design would be the head cover and the junction between the cover and the vessel wall and indicates the pattern of crack development. The results show that the development of a design adequate for current HCDA loads is quite feasible for pool-type or loop-type PCRVs.},

abstract = {Fluids of exciton polaritons, excitations of two-dimensional quantum wells in optical cavities, show collective phenomena akin to Bose condensation. However, a fundamental difference from standard condensates stems from the finite lifetime of these excitations, which necessitates continuous driving to maintain a steady state. A basic question is whether a two-dimensional condensate with long-range algebraic correlations can exist under these nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we show that such driven two-dimensional Bose systems cannot exhibit algebraic superfluid order except in low-symmetry, strongly anisotropic systems. Our result implies, in particular, that recent apparent evidence for Bose condensation of exciton polaritons must be an intermediate-scale crossover phenomenon, while the true long-distance correlations fall off exponentially. We obtain these results through a mapping of the long-wavelength condensate dynamics onto the anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.},

To enhance quantum coherence, here we propose to engineer the electromagnetic environment of LSPRs by placing metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) in optical microcavities. An analytical quantum model is first built to describe the LSPR-microcavity interaction, revealing the significantly enhanced coherent radiation and the reduced incoherent dissipation. Furthermore, when a quantum emitter interacts with the LSPRs in the cavity-engineered environment, its quantum yield is enhanced over 40 times and the radiative power over one order of magnitude, compared to those in the vacuum environment. Importantly, the cavity-engineered MNP-emitter system can enter the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics, providing a promising platform for the study of quantum plasmonics, quantum information processing, precise sensing, and spectroscopy.},

@article{Casetti1999,
abstract = {This paper is a review of results which have been recently obtained by applying mathematical concepts drawn, in particular, from differential geometry and topology, to the physics of Hamiltonian dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom of interest for statistical mechanics. The first part of the paper concerns the applications of methods used in classical differential geometry to study the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Starting from the identity between the trajectories of a dynamical system and the geodesics in its configuration space, a geometric theory of chaotic dynamics can be developed, which sheds new light on the origin of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. In fact, it appears that chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures, as was originally surmised, but also by positive curvatures, provided the curvatures are fluctuating along the geodesics. In the case of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom it is possible to give an analytical estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent by means of a geometric model independent of the dynamics. In the second part of the paper the phenomenon of phase transitions is addressed and it is here that topology comes into play. In fact, when a system undergoes a phase transition, the fluctuations of the configuration-space curvature exhibit a singular behavior at the phase transition point, which can be qualitatively reproduced using geometric models. In these models the origin of the singular behavior of the curvature fluctuations appears to be caused by a topological transition in configuration space. This leads us to put forward a Topological Hypothesis (TH). The content of the TH is that phase transitions would be related at a deeper level to a change in the topology of the configuration space of the system.},

The starting point is a microscopic description of the system in terms of a many-body quantum master equation, where coherent and driven-dissipative dynamics occur on an equal footing. An equivalent Keldysh real-time functional integral reformulation opens up the problem to a practical evaluation using the tools of quantum field theory. In particular, we develop a functional renormalization group approach to quantitatively explore the universality class of this stationary nonequilibrium system. Key results comprise the emergence of an asymptotic thermalization of the distribution function, while manifest nonequilibrium properties are witnessed in the response properties in terms of a new, independent critical exponent. Thus, the driven-dissipative microscopic nature is seen to bear observable consequences on the largest length scales. The absence of two symmetries present in closed equilibrium systems - underlying particle number conservation and detailed balance, respectively - is identified as the root of this new nonequilibrium critical behavior.

Our proposal relies on a background stationary field that consists of a kagome vortex lattice, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and induces a periodic potential for Bogoliubov excitations. In analogy to the Haldane model, no external magnetic field or net flux is required. We construct a generic model based on the two-dimensional nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation and demonstrate the emergence of topological gaps crossed by chiral Bogoliubov edge modes. Our scheme can be realized in a wide variety of physical systems ranging from nonlinear optical systems to exciton-polariton condensates.},

We determine a phase diagram for this system including fluctuation corrections to the mean-field theory. At low densities the condensation temperature Tc behaves like that for point bosons. At higher densities, when Tc approaches the Rabi splitting, Tc deviates from the form for point bosons, and instead approaches the result of a BCS-like mean-field theory. This crossover occurs at densities much less than the Mott density. We show that current experiments are in a density range where the phase boundary is described by the BCS-like mean-field boundary.

Here we propose and demonstrate the realization of an integrated microlaser where the chirality of the wavefront can be optically controlled. Importantly, the scheme that we use, based on the optical breaking of time-reversal symmetry in a semiconductor microcavity, can be extended to different laser architectures, thus paving the way to the realization of a new generation of OAM microlasers with tunable chirality.},

This is made possible thanks to long polariton lifetimes in high-quality samples with small disorder and in a reservoir-free region far away from the excitation spot, that allow topological ordering to prevail. The observed quasi-ordered phase, characteristic for an equilibrium 2D bosonic gas, with a decay of coherence in both spatial and temporal domains with the same algebraic exponent, is reproduced with numerical solutions of stochastic dynamics, proving that the mechanism of pairing of the topological defects (vortices) is responsible for the transition to the algebraic order. Finally, measurements in the weak-coupling regime confirm that polariton condensates are fundamentally different from photon lasers and constitute genuine quantum degenerate macroscopic states.},

High-critical temperature cuprate superconductors set the present record of ∼100{\^{a}} €‰K. Here we propose a design for artificially structured materials to rival this record. The main elements of the structure are two monolayers of a transition metal dichalcogenide separated by an atomically thin spacer.

In the linear limit, the SOC opens a minigap between flat and dispersive bands in the system's band-gap structure, and preserves the existence of CLSs at the flat-band frequency, simultaneously lowering their symmetry. Adding on-site cubic nonlinearity, the CLSs persist and remain available in an exact analytical form, with frequencies that are smoothly tuned into the minigap. Inside of the minigap, the CLS and DS families are stable in narrow areas adjacent to the FB. Deep inside the semi-infinite gap, both the CLSs and DSs are stable too.},

abstract = {The study of open quantum systems - microscopic systems exhibiting quantum coherence that are coupled to their environment - has become increasingly important in the past years, as the ability to control quantum coherence on a single particle level has been developed in a wide variety of physical systems. In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {A conceptual difficulty in formulating the density-functional theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect is that while in the standard approach the Kohn-Sham orbitals are either fully occupied or unoccupied, the physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect calls for fractionally occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals. This has necessitated averaging over an ensemble of Slater determinants to obtain meaningful results. We develop an alternative approach in which we express and minimize the grand canonical potential in terms of the composite fermion variables. This provides a natural resolution of the fractional-occupation problem because the fully occupied orbitals of composite fermions automatically correspond to fractionally occupied orbitals of electrons. We demonstrate the quantitative validity of our approach by evaluating the density profile of fractional Hall edge as a function of temperature and the distance from the delta dopant layer and showing that it reproduces edge reconstruction in the expected parameter region.},

abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe/CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1{\_}xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The effect of quantum statistics in quantum gases and liquids results in observable collective properties among many-particle systems. One prime example is Bose-Einstein condensation, whose onset in a quantum liquid leads to phenomena such as superfluidity and superconductivity. A Bose-Einstein condensate is generally defined as a macroscopic occupation of a single-particle quantum state, a phenomenon technically referred to as off-diagonal long-range order due to non-vanishing off-diagonal components of the single-particle density matrix1-3. The wave-function of the condensate is an order parameter whose phase is essential in characterizing the coherence and superfluid phenomena4-11. The long-range spatial coherence leads to the existence of phase-locked multiple condensates in an array of superfluid helium12, superconducting Josephson junctions13-15 or atomic Bose-Einstein condensates15-18. Under certain circumstances, a quantum phase difference of $\pi$ is predicted to develop among weakly coupled Josephson junctions19. Such a meta-stable $\pi$-state was discovered in a weak link of superfluid 3He, which is characterized by a 'p-wave' order parameter20. The possible existence of such a $\pi$-state in weakly coupled atomic Bose-Einstein condensates has also been proposed21, but remains undiscovered. Here we report the observation of spontaneous build-up of in-phase ('zero-state') and antiphase ('$\pi$-state') 'superfluid' states in a solid-state system; an array of exciton-polariton condensates connected by weak periodic potential barriers within a semiconductor microcavity.

abstract = {Conventional semiconductor laser emission relies on stimulated emission of photons, which sets stringent requirements on the minimum amount of energy necessary for its operation. In comparison, exciton-polaritons in strongly coupled quantum well microcavities can undergo stimulated scattering that promises more energy-efficient generation of coherent light by 'polariton lasers'. Polariton laser operation has been demonstrated in optically pumped semiconductor microcavities at temperatures up to room temperature, and such lasers can outperform their weak-coupling counterparts in that they have a lower threshold density. Even though polariton diodes have been realized, electrically pumped polariton laser operation, which is essential for practical applications, has not been achieved until now. Here we present an electrically pumped polariton laser based on a microcavity containing multiple quantum wells. To prove polariton laser emission unambiguously, we apply a magnetic field and probe the hybrid light-matter nature of the polaritons. Our results represent an important step towards the practical implementation of polaritonic light sources and electrically injected condensates, and can be extended to room-temperature operation using wide-bandgap materials. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The dynamics of M -site, N -particle Bose-Hubbard systems is described in quantum phase space constructed in terms of generalized SU (M) coherent states. These states have a special significance for these systems as they describe fully condensed states. Based on the differential algebra developed by Gilmore, we derive an explicit evolution equation for the (generalized) Husimi (Q) and Glauber-Sudarshan (P) distributions. Most remarkably, these evolution equations turn out to be second-order differential equations where the second-order terms scale as 1/N with the particle number. For large N the evolution reduces to a (classical) Liouvillian dynamics. The phase-space approach thus provides a distinguished instrument to explore the mean-field many-particle crossover. In addition, the thermodynamic Bloch equation is analyzed using similar techniques. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

In the majority of examples, a dispersive band touches the flat band(s) at a number of discrete points in momentum space. We demonstrate that this band touching is related to states which exhibit nontrivial topology in real-space. Specifically, these states have support on one-dimensional loops which wind around the entire system (with periodic boundary conditions). A counting argument is given that determines, in each case, whether there is band touching or none, in precise correspondence to the result of straightforward diagonalization. When they are present, the topological structure protects the band touchings in the sense that they can only be removed by perturbations, which also split the degeneracy of the flat band. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Exciton-polaritons are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles formed by strongly interacting photons and excitons (electron-hole pairs) in semiconductor microcavities. They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications as well as for fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly open (that is, non-Hermitian) quantum system, which requires constant pumping of energy and continuously decays, releasing coherent radiation. Thus, the exciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and loss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far been largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that non-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral degeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their quantum transport, localization and dynamical properties. Using a spatially structured optical pump, we create a chaotic exciton-polariton billiard-a two-dimensional area enclosed by a curved potential barrier. Eigenmodes of this billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies, known as exceptional points. Such points can cause remarkable wave phenomena, such as unidirectional transport, anomalous lasing/absorption and chiral modes. By varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and anti-crossing of energy levels and reveal the non-trivial topological modal structure exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. We also observe mode switching and a topological Berry phase for a parameter loop encircling the exceptional point. Our findings pave the way to studies of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of exciton-polaritons, which may uncover novel operating principles for polariton-based devices.},

In the presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically nonequilibrium nature. A rich variety of recently observed photon hydrodynamical effects is presented, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While the review is mostly focused on a specific class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of the article is devoted to a review of the future perspectives in the direction of strongly correlated photon gases and of artificial gauge fields for photons. In particular, several mechanisms to obtain efficient photon blockade are presented, together with their application to the generation of novel quantum phases. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

While propagating in a uniform medium, the first bright ring of the aLG beam becomes less asymmetric and the energy is redistributed toward peripheral diffraction rings. The projection of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) onto the optical axis is calculated. The OAM is shown to grow quadratically with increasing asymmetry parameter of the aLG beam, which equals the ratio of the shift to the waist radius. Conditions for the OAM becoming equal to the topological charge have been derived. For aLG beams with zero radial index, we have deduced an expression to define the intensity maximum coordinates and shown the crescent-shaped intensity pattern to rotate during propagation. Results of the experimental generation and rotation of aLG beams agree well with theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {We show that flat bands can be categorized into two distinct classes, that is, singular and nonsingular flat bands, by exploiting the singular behavior of their Bloch wave functions in momentum space. In the case of a singular flat band, its Bloch wave function possesses immovable discontinuities generated by the band-crossing with other bands, and thus the vector bundle associated with the flat band cannot be defined. This singularity precludes the compact localized states from forming a complete set spanning the flat band. Once the degeneracy at the band crossing point is lifted, the singular flat band becomes dispersive and can acquire a finite Chern number in general, suggesting a new route for obtaining a nearly flat Chern band. On the other hand, the Bloch wave function of a nonsingular flat band has no singularity, and thus forms a vector bundle. A nonsingular flat band can be completely isolated from other bands while preserving the perfect flatness. All one-dimensional flat bands belong to the nonsingular class. We show that a singular flat band displays a novel bulk-boundary correspondence such that the presence of the robust boundary mode is guaranteed by the singularity of the Bloch wave function. Moreover, we develop a general scheme to construct a flat band model Hamiltonian in which one can freely design its singular or nonsingular nature. Finally, we propose a general formula for the compact localized state spanning the flat band, which can be easily implemented in numerics and offer a basis set useful in analyzing correlation effects in flat bands.},

This localization can be described as a quantum analogue of a self-induced optical lattice between two indistinguishable photons, where one photon creates a standing wave that traps the other photon.

We highlight that the current experimental configuration allows rapid, interchangeable cavity coupling to 4 profiles with an overlap parameter of less than 10{\%}, enough to demonstrate, for example, a quantum repeater network simulation in the cavity.

@article{Konig2008,
abstract = {The search for topologically non-trivial states of matter has become an important goal for condensed matter physics. Recently, a new class of topological insulators has been proposed. These topological insulators have an insulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to the time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in the absence of any external magnetic field. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells (QWs). By varying the thickness of the QW, the band structure changes from a normal to an "inverted" type at a critical thickness dc. We present an analytical solution of the helical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We also review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te QWs. We review both the fabrication of the sample and the experimental setup. For thin QWs with well width dQW {\textless} 6:3 nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker QWs (dQW {\textgreater} 6:3 nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2=h. The residual conductance is independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, dc = 6:3 nm, is also independently determined from the occurrence of a magnetic field induced insulator to metal transition. {\textcopyright}2008 The Physical Society of Japan.},

abstract = {A theoretical description of radiation-matter coupling for semiconductor-based photonic crystal slabs is presented, in which quantum wells are embedded within the waveguide core layer. A full quantum theory is developed by quantizing both the electromagnetic field with a spatial modulation of the refractive index and the exciton center-of-mass field in a periodic piecewise constant potential. The second-quantized Hamiltonian of the interacting system is diagonalized with a generalized Hopfield method, thus yielding the complex dispersion of mixed exciton-photon modes including losses. The occurrence of both weak- and strong-coupling regimes is studied, and it is concluded that the new eigenstates of the system are described by quasiparticles called photonic crystal polaritons, which can occur in two situations as follows: (i) below the light line, when a resonance between exciton and nonradiative photon levels occurs (guided polaritons) and (ii) above the light line, provided that the exciton-photon coupling is larger than the intrinsic radiative damping of the resonant photonic mode (radiative polaritons). For a square lattice of air holes, it is found that the energy minimum of the lower polariton branch can occur around normal incidence. The latter result has potential implications for the realization of polariton parametric interactions in photonic crystal slabs. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We address the effect of nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions on the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, with alternating hopping amplitudes t1 and t2. Both numerically and analytically, we show that the presence of interactions induces phase transitions between topologically different regimes. In the particular case of one-hole excitations in a half-filled SSH chain, the V/t2 versus t1/t2 phase diagram has topological phases at diagonal regions of the phase plane. The interaction acts in this case as a passivation potential. For general filling of the SSH chain, different eigensubspaces of the SSH Hamiltonian may be classified as topologically trivial and nontrivial. The two-hole case is studied in detail in the large interaction limit, and we show that a mapping can be constructed of the two-hole SSH eigensubspaces into one-particle states of a noninteracting one-dimensional (1D) tight-binding model, with interfaces between regions with different hopping constants and local potentials. The presence of edge states of topological origin in the equivalent chain can be readily identified, as well as their correspondence to the original two-hole states. Of these states only some, identified by us, are protected and, therefore, truly topological. Furthermore, we found that the presence of the NN interaction generates a state where two holes occupy two consecutive edge states. Such many-body states should also occur for arbitrary filling leading to the possibility of a macroscopic hole gathering at the surface (at consecutive edge states).},

abstract = {The quantum Rabi model is in the scientific spotlight due to the recent theoretical and experimental progress. Nevertheless, a full-fledged classification of its coupling regimes remains as a relevant open question. We propose a spectral classification dividing the coupling regimes into three regions based on the validity of perturbative criteria on the quantum Rabi model, which allows us the use of exactly solvable effective Hamiltonians. These coupling regimes are (i) the perturbative ultrastrong coupling regime which comprises the Jaynes-Cummings model, (ii) a region where nonperturbative ultrastrong and nonperturbative deep strong coupling regimes coexist, and (iii) the perturbative deep strong coupling regime. We show that this spectral classification depends not only on the ratio between the coupling strength and the natural frequencies of the unperturbed parts, but also on the energy to which the system can access. These regimes additionally discriminate the completely different behaviors of several static physical properties, namely the total number of excitations, the photon statistics of the field, and the cavity-qubit entanglement. Finally, we explain the dynamical properties which are traditionally associated with the deep strong coupling regime, such as the collapses and revivals of the state population, in the frame of the proposed spectral classification.},

Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The recently developed notion of parity-time (PT) symmetry in optical systems has spawned intriguing prospects. So far, most experimental implementations have been reported in solid-state systems. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of optical anti-PT symmetry - the counterpart of conventional PT symmetry - in a warm atomic-vapour cell. Rapid coherence transport via flying atoms leads to a dissipative coupling between two long-lived atomic spin waves, allowing for the observation of the essential features of anti-PT symmetry with unprecedented precision on the phase-transition threshold, as well as refractionless light propagation. Moreover, we show that a linear or nonlinear interaction between the two spatially separated beams can be achieved. Our results advance non-Hermitian physics by bridging to the field of atomic, molecular and optical physics, where new phenomena and applications in quantum and nonlinear optics aided by (anti-)PT symmetry could be anticipated.},

Analytic forms of the coupling matrix elements valid in the long-wavelength limit are found to give an almost quantitative description of the first-principles matrix elements even at shorter wavelengths. Using the analytic forms of the coupling matrix elements, we study the acoustic phonon-limited carrier mobility and quasiparticle lifetime observable in photoemission spectroscopy for temperatures 0-200 K and high carrier densities of 1012-1013 cm -2. We find that the intrinsic effective acoustic deformation potential of graphene is $\Xi$ eff=6.8 eV and that the temperature dependence of the mobility $\mu$∼T -$\alpha$ in the Bloch-Gr{\"{u}}neisen regime increases beyond an $\alpha$=4 dependence even in the absence of screening when the true coupling matrix elements are considered. The $\alpha$4 temperature dependence of the mobility is found to originate in a similar temperature dependence of the relaxation time at the Fermi level. The large disagreement between our calculated deformation potential and those extracted from experimental measurements (18-29 eV) indicates that additional or modified acoustic phonon-scattering mechanisms are at play in experimental situations. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In most introductory courses on quantum mechanics one is taught that the Hamiltonian operator must be Hermitian in order that the energy levels be real and that the theory be unitary (probability conserving). To express the Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian, one writes H = H†, where the symbol † denotes the usual Dirac Hermitian conjugation; that is, transpose and complex conjugate. In the past few years it has been recognized that the requirement of Hermiticity, which is often stated as an axiom of quantum mechanics, may be replaced by the less mathematical and more physical requirement of space-time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry) without losing any of the essential physical features of quantum mechanics. Theories defined by non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit strange and unexpected properties at the classical as well as at the quantum level. This paper explains how the requirement of Hermiticity can be evaded and discusses the properties of some non-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum theories. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis Group Ltd.},

By fitting the experimental data with a microscopic quantum theory based on a quantum jump approach, we scrutinize the influence of pump power and confinement and find that phonon-mediated transitions are enhanced in the case of a confined structure, in which the modes split into a discrete set.

If the coupling strength g becomes as large as the atomic and cavity frequencies (" and ‰ o, respectively), the energy eigenstates including the ground state are predicted to be highly entangled. There has been an ongoing debate over whether it is fundamentally possible to realize this regime in realistic physical systems.

Using spectroscopy measurements, we have observed unconventional transition spectra that are characteristic of this new regime.

abstract = {Abstract. $\backslash$nA system where a Bose-Einstein condensate of exciton-polaritons coexists with a Fermi gas of electrons has been recently proposed as promising for realization of room-temperature superconductivity. In order to find the optimum conditions for exciton and exciton-polariton mediated superconductivity, we studied the attractive mechanism between electrons of a Cooper pair mediated by the exciton and exciton-polariton condensate. We also analyzed the gap equation that follows. We specifically examined microcavities with embedded n-doped quantum wells as well as coupled quantum wells hosting a condensate of spatially indirect excitons, put in contact with a two-dimensional electron gas. An effective potential of interaction between electrons was derived as a function of their exchanged energy ℏ$\omega$, taking into account the retardation effect that allows two negatively charged carriers to feel an attraction. In the polariton case, the interaction is weakly attractive at long times, followed by a succession of strongly attractive and strongly repulsive windows. Strikingly, this allows high critical temperature solutions of the gap equation. An approximate three-steps potential is used to explain this result that is also obtained numerically. The case of polaritons can be compared with that of excitons, which realize the conventional scenario of high-Tc superconductivity where a large coupling strength accounts straightforwardly for the high critical temperatures. Excitons are less advantageous than polaritons but may be simpler systems to realize experimentally. It is concluded that engineering of the interaction in these peculiar Bose–Fermi mixtures is complex and sometimes counter-intuitive, but leaves much freedom for optimization, thereby promising the realization of high-temperature superconductivity in multilayered semiconductor structures.},

abstract = {We describe the behavior of a repulsively interacting Bose-Einstein condensate of indirect dipolar exciton gas in a double quantum well (QW) system under external static or dynamic electric fields at finite temperatures. Electrostatic perturbation is considered to be created by an impurity atom or shot-range defect of QW fluctuation. The screening of this defect potential by an exciton condensate is studied. We find asymptotic spatial dependence of the screened potential and analyse its dependence on the temperature and exciton concentration. It is shown that the asymptotic of the screened potential has a steep power law dependence in contrast to the well known results of electron gas. This peculiarity reflects the bosonic nature of the exciton condensate. The behavior of exciton condensate under external alternative field created by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) is examined in detail. We focus our attention on the dependence of SAW absorption coefficient on temperature and exciton concentration. We found that at zero temperatures Landau damping does not contribute to the SAW absorption, but the Belyaev mechanism produces unusual behavior of SAW absorption coefficient on exciton concentration: if the exciton concentration exceeds some critical value, the SAW absorption vanishes. At finite temperatures Landau damping comes into action and results in washing out the sharp absorption behavior. Such unusual SAW absorption properties can be used for experimental evidence of the exciton condensation. This method is also applicable to the experimental testing of both dark and bright exciton condensates, that is impossible to do with the optical luminescence technique.},

abstract = {Topological materials have become the focus of intense research in recent years, since they exhibit fundamentally new physical phenomena with potential applications for novel devices and quantum information technology. One of the hallmarks of topological materials is the existence of protected gapless surface states, which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bulk wave functions. This review provides a pedagogical introduction into the field of topological quantum matter with an emphasis on classification schemes. Both fully gapped and gapless topological materials and their classification in terms of nonspatial symmetries, such as time reversal, as well as spatial symmetries, such as reflection, are considered. Furthermore, the classification of gapless modes localized on topological defects is surveyed. The classification of these systems is discussed by use of homotopy groups, Clifford algebras, K theory, and nonlinear sigma models describing the Anderson (de)localization at the surface or inside a defect of the material. Theoretical model systems and their topological invariants are reviewed together with recent experimental results in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective of the field. While the bulk of this article is concerned with the topological properties of noninteracting or mean-field Hamiltonians, a brief overview of recent results and open questions concerning the topological classifications of interacting systems is also provided.},

In spite of these impressive achievements, such processors are still based on the so-called von Neumann architecture, which is a bottleneck for faster and power-efficient neuromorphic computation. Therefore, one of the main goals of research is to conceive physical realizations of artificial neural networks capable of performing fully parallel and ultrafast operations. Here we show that lattices of exciton-polariton condensates accomplish neuromorphic computing with outstanding accuracy thanks to their high optical nonlinearity. We demonstrate that our neural network significantly increases the recognition efficiency compared with the linear classification algorithms on one of the most widely used benchmarks, the MNIST problem, showing a concrete advantage from the integration of optical systems in neural network architectures.},

BEC has, for example, famously been demonstrated in dilute atom gas of rubidium atoms at temperatures below 200 nanokelvin. Much effort has been devoted to finding a solid-state system in which BEC can take place. Promising candidate systems are semiconductor microcavities, in which photons are confined and strongly coupled to electronic excitations, leading to the creation of exciton polaritons. These bosonic quasi-particles are 109 times lighter than rubidium atoms, thus theoretically permitting BEC to occur at standard cryogenic temperatures. Here we detail a comprehensive set of experiments giving compelling evidence for BEC of polaritons. Above a critical density, we observe massive occupation of the ground state developing from a polariton gas at thermal equilibrium at 19 K, an increase of temporal coherence, and the build-up of long-range spatial coherence and linear polarization, all of which indicate the spontaneous onset of a macroscopic quantum phase. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation is studied for a periodic sequence of delta-potentials (a delta-comb) or narrow Gaussian potentials. For the delta-comb the time-independent nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation can be solved analytically in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions and thus provides useful insight into the features of nonlinear stationary states of periodic potentials. Phenomena well-known from classical chaos are found, such as a bifurcation of periodic stationary states and a transition to spatial chaos. The relation to new features of nonlinear Bloch bands, such as looped and period doubled bands, are analyzed in detail. An analytic expression for the critical nonlinearity for the emergence of looped bands is derived. The results for the delta-comb are generalized to a more realistic potential consisting of a periodic sequence of narrow Gaussian peaks and the dynamical stability of periodic solutions in a Gaussian comb is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

abstract = {All Bloch states of the mean field of a Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of a one-dimensional lattice are presented in closed analytic form. The band structure is investigated by analyzing the stationary states of the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger, or Gross-Pitaevskii, equation for both repulsive and attractive condensates. The appearance of swallowtails in the bands is examined and interpreted in terms of the condensates superfluid properties. The nonlinear stability properties of the Bloch states are described and the stable regions of the bands and swallowtails are mapped out. We find that the Kronig-Penney potential has the same properties as a sinusoidal potential. Bose-Einstein condensates are trapped in sinusoidal optical lattices. The Kronig-Penney potential has the advantage of being analytically tractable, unlike the sinusoidal potential, and, therefore, serves as a good model for understanding experimental phenomena. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

The effect appears due to strong polariton-polariton repulsion and it depends on the type of the single-particle dispersion of the miniband, which can be fine tuned by the real and imaginary components of the potential. As a result, the condensate can be formed in a {\$}0{\$}-state, {\$}\backslashpi{\$}-state, or mixed state of spatiotemporal intermittency, depending on the shape of the miniband, strength of interparticle interaction, and distribution of losses in the system. The reconstruction of the condensate wave function takes place by proliferation of nuclei of the new condensate phase in the form of dark solitons. We show that, in general, the interacting polaritons are not condensed in the state with minimal losses, neither they accumulate in the state with a well-defined wave vector.},

abstract = {We study Bogoliubov excitations of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate in a honeycomb periodic potential, in the presence of a Zeeman field and of a spin-orbit coupling specific for photonic systems, which is due to the energy splitting between TE and TM polarized eigenstates. We also consider spin-anisotropic interactions typical for cavity polaritons. We show that the nontrivial topology of the single-particle case is also present for the interacting system. At low condensate density, the topology of the single-particle bands is transferred to the bogolon dispersion. At a critical value, the self-induced Zeeman field at the Dirac points of the dispersion becomes equal to the real Zeeman field and then exceeds it. The gap is thus closed and then reopened with inverted Chern numbers. This change of topology is accompanied by a change of the propagation directions of the one-way edge modes. This result demonstrates that the chirality of a topological insulator can be reversed by collective effects in a Bose-Einstein condensate.},

abstract = {Achieving control over light-matter interaction in custom-tailored nanostructures is at the core of modern quantum electrodynamics. In strongly and ultrastrongly coupled systems, the excitation is repeatedly exchanged between a resonator and an electronic transition at a rate known as the vacuum Rabi frequency $\Omega$R. For $\Omega$R approaching the resonance frequency $\omega$c, novel quantum phenomena including squeezed states, Dicke superradiant phase transitions, the collapse of the Purcell effect, and a population of the ground state with virtual photon pairs are predicted. Yet, the experimental realization of optical systems with $\Omega$R/$\omega$c ≥ 1 has remained elusive. Here, we introduce a paradigm change in the design of light-matter coupling by treating the electronic and the photonic components of the system as an entity instead of optimizing them separately. Using the electronic excitation to not only boost the electronic polarization but furthermore tailor the shape of the vacuum mode, we push $\Omega$R/$\omega$c of cyclotron resonances ultrastrongly coupled to metamaterials far beyond unity. As one prominent illustration of the unfolding possibilities, we calculate a ground state population of 0.37 virtual photons for our best structure with $\Omega$R/$\omega$c = 1.43 and suggest a realistic experimental scenario for measuring vacuum radiation by cutting-edge terahertz quantum detection.},

We compare the results to those that we obtain by adiabatic full-bandwidth, as well as Fermi-surface-restricted Eliashberg-theory calculations. We find that nonadiabatic contributions to the superconducting gap can be positive, negative, or negligible, depending on the dimensionality of the considered system, the degree of nonadiabaticity, and the coupling strength. We further examine nonadiabatic effects on the transition temperature and the electron-phonon coupling constant. Our treatment emphasizes the importance of overcoming previously employed approximations in estimating the impact of vertex corrections on superconductivity and opens a pathway to systematically study vertex correction effects in systems such as high-Tc, flat band, and low-carrier density superconductors.},

abstract = {The Hamiltonian H specifies the energy levels and time evolution of a quantum, theory. A standard axiom of quantum mechanics requires that H be Hermitian because Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that time evolution is unitary (probability-preserving). This paper describes an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics in which the mathematical axiom of Hermiticity (transpose + complex conjugate) is replaced by the physically transparent condition of space-time reflection (PT) symmetry. If H has an unbroken PT symmetry, then the spectrum is real. Examples of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H = p̂ 2+ix̂3 and H = p̂2 - x̂4. Amazingly, the energy levels of these Hamiltonians are all real and positive! Does a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian H specify a physical quantum theory in which the norms of states are positive and time evolution is unitary? The answer is that if H has an unbroken PT symmetry, then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator C. In terms of C, one can construct a time-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus, PT-symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution. The Lee model provides an excellent example of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian has a negative-norm 'ghost' state because renormalization causes the Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost, but all such attempts failed. The correct interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee-model Hamiltonian is PT-symmetric. The C operator for the Lee model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm. The ideas of PT symmetry are illustrated by using many quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models. {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Although this describes the highly occupied modes of the gas below a momentum cutoff, we have developed a method to incorporate the higher momentum states in our model. We concentrate on finite-sized homogeneous systems in order to simplify the analysis of the vortex pairing. We determine the dependence of the condensate fraction on temperature and compare this to the calculated superfluid fraction. By measuring the first order correlation function we determine the boundary of the Bose-Einstein condensate and BKT phases, and find it is consistent with the superfluid fraction decreasing to zero. We reveal the characteristic unbinding of vortex pairs above the BKT transition via a coarse-graining procedure.

We develop protocols of soliton creation and destruction. The switch to a solitonlike behavior occurs if the cavity is exposed by a short strong laser pulse with certain energy and duration.

In particular, we demonstrate surprising narrowing of the spatial profile of the soliton and its vanishing at certain temperature due to interaction of the system with the thermal bath of acoustic phonons.

On 23 January 2017, as part of the sounding-rocket mission MAIUS-1, we created Bose–Einstein condensates in space and conducted 110 experiments central to matter-wave interferometry, including laser cooling and trapping of atoms in the presence of the large accelerations experienced during launch. Here we report on experiments conducted during the six minutes of in-space flight in which we studied the phase transition from a thermal ensemble to a Bose–Einstein condensate and the collective dynamics of the resulting condensate. Our results provide insights into conducting cold-atom experiments in space, such as precision interferometry, and pave the way to miniaturizing cold-atom and photon-based quantum information concepts for satellite-based implementation.

abstract = {In a microcavity, light-matter coupling is quantified by the vacuum-Rabi frequency $\Omega$R. When $\Omega$R is larger than radiative and nonradiative loss rates, the system eigenstates (polaritons) are linear superposition of photonic and electronic excitations, a condition actively investigated in diverse physical implementations. Recently, a quantum electrodynamic regime (ultrastrong coupling) was predicted when $\Omega$R becomes comparable to the transition frequency. Here we report signatures of this regime in a quantum-well intersubband microcavity. Measuring the cavity-polariton dispersion in a room-temperature linear optical experiment, we directly observe the antiresonant light-matter coupling and the photon-energy renormalization of the vacuum field. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

Quadratic coupling of electrons with out-of-plane phonons is considered in details, taking into account both deformation potential and bond-stretch contributions. The order parameter of electron-electron pairing can have different structures due to four-component spinor character of electrons wave function. We consider s-wave pairing, diagonal on conduction and valence bands, but having arbitrary structure with respect to valley degree of freedom. The sign and magnitude of contribution of each phonon mode to effective electron-electron interaction turns out to depend on both the symmetry of phonon mode and the structure of the order parameter.

Contrary to non-modulated cavities, where condensates expand, here, we observe spontaneous condensation in localized gap soliton states. Depending on excitation conditions, we access different dynamical regimes: we demonstrate the formation of gap solitons either moving along the ridge or bound to the potential created by the reservoir of uncondensed excitons. We also find Josephson oscillations of gap solitons triggered between the two sides of the reservoir.

abstract = {We calculate the effect of the electron-phonon interaction on the electronic density of states (DOS), the quasiparticle properties, and on the optical conductivity of graphene. In metals with DOS constant on the scale of phonon energies, the electron-phonon renormalizations drop out of the dressed DOS, however, due to the Dirac nature of the electron dynamics in graphene, the band DOS is linear in energy and phonon structures remain, which can be emphasized by taking an energy derivative. There is a shift in the chemical potential and in the position in energy of the Dirac point. Also, the DOS can be changed from a linear dependence out of value zero at the Dirac point to quadratic out of a finite value. The optical scattering rate 1/$\tau$ sets the energy scale for the rise of the optical conductivity from its universal dc value 4 e2 /$\pi$h (expected in the simplest theory when chemical potential and temperature are both 1/2$\tau$) to its universal ac background value ($\sigma$0 =$\pi$ e2 /2h). As in ordinary metals the dc conductivity remains unrenormalized while its ac value is changed. The optical spectral weight under the intraband Drude is reduced by a mass-renormalization factor as is the effective scattering rate. Optical weight is transferred to an Holstein phonon-assisted side band. Due to Pauli blocking the interband transitions are sharply suppressed, but also nearly constant, below twice the value of renormalized chemical potential and also exhibit a phonon-assisted contribution. The universal background conductivity is reduced below $\sigma$0 at large energies. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

In particular, we focus on the validity of the adiabatic approximation and small density fluctuations approximation that allow one to reduce the coupled condensate-reservoir dynamics to a single partial differential equation. We find that the adiabatic approximation consists of three independent analytical conditions that have to be fulfilled simultaneously. By investigating stochastic versions of the two corresponding models, we verify that the breakdown of these approximations can lead to discrepancies in correlation lengths and distributions of fluctuations. Additionally, we consider the phase diffusion and number fluctuations of a condensate in a box, and show that self-consistent description requires treatment beyond the typical Bogoliubov approximation.},

abstract = {The realization of mixtures of excitons and charge carriers in van der Waals materials presents a frontier for the study of the many-body physics of strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures. In order to derive an effective low-energy model for such systems, we develop an exact diagonalization approach based on a discrete variable representation that predicts the scattering and bound state properties of three charges in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. From the solution of the quantum mechanical three-body problem we thus obtain the bound state energies of excitons and trions within an effective mass model which are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo predictions. The diagonalization approach also gives access to excited states of the three-body system. This allows us to predict the scattering phase shifts of electrons and excitons that serve as input for a low-energy theory of interacting mixtures of excitons and charge carriers at finite density. To this end we derive an effective exciton-electron scattering potential that is directly applicable for quantum Monte Carlo or diagrammatic many-body techniques. As an example, we demonstrate the approach by studying the many-body physics of exciton Fermi polarons in transition-metal dichalcogenides, and we show that finite-range corrections have a substantial impact on the optical absorption spectrum. Our approach can be applied to a plethora of many-body phenomena realizable in atomically thin semiconductors ranging from exciton localization to induced superconductivity.},

abstract = {The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism, in which a phase transition is mediated by the proliferation of topological defects, governs the critical behavior of a wide range of equilibrium twodimensional systems with a continuous symmetry, ranging from spin systems to superconducting thin films and two-dimensional Bose fluids, such as liquid helium and ultracold atoms. We show here that this phenomenon is not restricted to thermal equilibrium, rather it survives more generally in a dissipative highly nonequilibrium system driven into a steady state. By considering a quantum fluid of polaritons of an experimentally relevant size, in the so-called optical parametric oscillator regime, we demonstrate that it indeed undergoes a phase transition associated with a vortex binding-unbinding mechanism. Yet, the exponent of the power-law decay of the first-order correlation function in the (algebraically) ordered phase can exceed the equilibrium upper limit: this shows that the ordered phase of driven-dissipative systems can sustain a higher level of collective excitations before the order is destroyed by topological defects. Our work suggests that the macroscopic coherence phenomena, observed recently in interacting twodimensional light-matter systems, result from a nonequilibrium phase transition of the Berezinskii- Kosterlitz-Thouless rather than the Bose-Einstein condensation type.},

abstract = {Spin Hall effects are a collection of relativistic spin-orbit coupling phenomena in which electrical currents can generate transverse spin currents and vice versa. Despite being observed only a decade ago, these effects are already ubiquitous within spintronics, as standard spin-current generators and detectors. Here the theoretical and experimental results that have established this subfield of spintronics are reviewed. The focus is on the results that have converged to give us the current understanding of the phenomena, which has evolved from a qualitative to a more quantitative measurement of spin currents and their associated spin accumulation. Within the experimental framework, optical-, transport-, and magnetization-dynamics-based measurements are reviewed and linked to both phenomenological and microscopic theories of the effect. Within the theoretical framework, the basic mechanisms in both the extrinsic and intrinsic regimes are reviewed, which are linked to the mechanisms present in their closely related phenomenon in ferromagnets, the anomalous Hall effect. Also reviewed is the connection to the phenomenological treatment based on spin-diffusion equations applicable to certain regimes, as well as the spin-pumping theory of spin generation used in many measurements of the spin Hall angle. A further connection to the spin-current-generating spin Hall effect to the inverse spin galvanic effect is given, in which an electrical current induces a nonequilibrium spin polarization. This effect often accompanies the spin Hall effect since they share common microscopic origins. Both can exhibit the same symmetries when present in structures comprising ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers through their induced current-driven spin torques or induced voltages. Although a short chronological overview of the evolution of the spin Hall effect field and the resolution of some early controversies is given, the main body of this review is structured from a pedagogical point of view, focusing on well-established and accepted physics. In such a young field, there remains much to be understood and explored, hence some of the future challenges and opportunities of this rapidly evolving area of spintronics are outlined.},

In this article a review of the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials is given. The first part of the article summarizes the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. The second part discusses a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem and establishes the connection with practical first-principles calculations.

We identify the topological invariants that distinguish the AFAI from a trivial, fully localized phase, and show that the two phases are separated by a phase transition.},

abstract = {A Bose–Einstein condensate is the ground state of a dilute gas of bosons, such as atoms cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero1. With much smaller mass, excitons (bound electron–hole pairs) are expected to condense at considerably higher temperatures2–7. Two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors with very strong exciton binding are ideal systems for the study of high-temperature exciton condensation. Here we study electrically generated interlayer excitons in MoSe2–WSe2 atomic double layers with a density of up to 1012 excitons per square centimetre. The interlayer tunnelling current depends only on the exciton density, which is indicative of correlated electron–hole pair tunnelling8. Strong electroluminescence arises when a hole tunnels from WSe2 to recombine with an electron in MoSe2. We observe a critical threshold dependence of the electroluminescence intensity on exciton density, accompanied by super-Poissonian photon statistics near the threshold, and a large electroluminescence enhancement with a narrow peak at equal electron and hole densities. The phenomenon persists above 100 kelvin, which is consistent with the predicted critical condensation temperature9–12. Our study provides evidence for interlayer exciton condensation in two-dimensional atomic double layers and opens up opportunities for exploring condensate-based optoelectronics and exciton-mediated high-temperature superconductivity13.},

abstract = {The modulation by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) provides a powerful tool for the formation of tunable lattices of exciton-polariton macroscopic quantum states (MQSs) in semiconductor microcavities. The MQSs were resonantly excited in an optical parametric oscillator configuration. We investigate the temporal dynamics of these lattices using time and spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL). Photoluminescence images of the MQSs clearly show the motion of the lattice at the acoustic velocity. Interestingly, the PL intensity emitted by the MQSs as well as their coherence length oscillate with the position of the lattice sites relative to the exciting laser beam. The coherence length and the PL intensity are correlated. The PL oscillation amplitude depends on both the intensity and the size of the exciting laser spot and increases considerably for excitation intensities close to the optical threshold power for the formation of the MQS. The oscillations are explained by a model that takes into account the combined effects of SAW reflections, which dynamically distort the amplitude of the potential, and the spatial phase of the acoustic lattice within the exciting laser spot. This paper could pave the way to tailor polariton-based light-emitting sources with intensity variations controlled by the SAWs.},

abstract = {I discuss the impact of gauge-gravity duality on our understanding of two classes of systems: conformal quantum matter and compressible quantum matter. The first conformal class includes systems, such as the boson Hubbard model in two spatial dimensions, which display quantum critical points described by conformal field theories. Questions associated with nonzero temperature dynamics and transport are difficult to answer using conventional field-theoretic methods. I argue that many of these can be addressed systematically using gauge-gravity duality and discuss the prospects for reliable computation of low-frequency correlations. Compressible quantum matter is characterized by the smooth dependence of the charge density, associated with a global U(1) symmetry, upon a chemical potential. Familiar examples are solids, superfluids, and Fermi liquids, but there are more exotic possibilities involving deconfined phases of gauge fields in the presence of Fermi surfaces. I survey the compressible systems studied using gauge-gravity duality and discuss their relationship to the condensed matter classification of such states. The gravity methods offer hope of a deeper understanding of exotic and strongly coupled compressible quantum states. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

We study fluctuations about the steady state and discuss how the multiple baths interact to set the system's distribution function.

abstract = {Polaritonic materials, owing to a strong phonon-polariton resonance in the THz and far-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, offer both high-index dielectric and metallic response in this regime. This complex response makes them suitable candidates for the design of metamaterial-related phenomena and applications. Here we show that one type of polaritonic-material-based structures that are particularly suitable for the achievement of a wide range of metamaterial properties are systems of polaritonic rods. To study the interplay between the material and the structural resonances in such systems we employ as model systems rods of LiF and SiC and we calculate first the scattering properties of a single rod, identifying and discussing the behavior of the different resonances for different rod diameters. To analyze the response of ensembles of polaritonic rods we employ an effective medium approach based on the Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA), which is shown to be superior to the simple Maxwell-Garnett approximation for polaritonic and high-index dielectric metamaterials. Calculating and analyzing the CPA effective parameters, we found that our systems exhibit a large variety of interesting metamaterial properties, including hyperbolic dispersion, epsilon-near-zero and negative refractive index response. This rich response, achievable in almost any system of polaritonic rods, is highly engineerable by properly selecting the radius and the filling ratio of the rods, making polaritonic rod systems an ideal platform for demonstration of multifunctional metamaterials.},

We then find and analyze the cores of singular vortices with non-Abelian charges in the point-group symmetry of a spin-3 Cr52 condensate. Using a simpler model system, we analyze the underlying dipolar physics and show how a characteristic length scale arising from the magnetic dipolar coupling interacts with the hierarchy of healing lengths of the s-wave scattering and leads to simple criteria for the core structure: When the interactions both energetically favor the ground-state spin condition, such as in the spin-1 ferromagnetic phase, the size of singular vortices is restricted to the shorter spin-dependent healing length (s-wave or dipolar). Conversely, when the interactions compete (e.g., in the spin-1 polar phase), we find that the core of a singular vortex is enlarged by increasing dipolar coupling. We further demonstrate how the spin alignment arising from the interaction anisotropy is manifest in the appearance of a ground-state spin-vortex line that is oriented perpendicularly to the condensate axis of rotation, as well as in potentially observable internal core spin textures. We also explain how it leads to an interaction-dependent angular momentum in nonsingular vortices as a result of competition with rotation-induced spin ordering. When the anisotropy is modified by a strong magnetic field, we show how it gives rise to a symmetry-breaking deformation of a vortex core into a spin-domain wall.},

The evolution of a low-density compact polariton condensate shows fast Rabi oscillations between its excitonic and photonic components, with slow beatings of the Rabi oscillation amplitude. At higher polariton densities the Rabi oscillations are still present, but their beatings are smeared out due to the polariton-polariton repulsion and distributed losses in the lattice.

Knowledge of the quantum metric is essential for understanding many phenomena, such as superfluidity in flat bands5, orbital magnetic susceptibility6,7, the exciton Lamb shift8 and the non-adiabatic anomalous Hall effect6,9. However, the quantum geometry of energy bands has not been measured. Here we report the direct measurement of both the Berry curvature and the quantum metric in a two-dimensional continuous medium—a high-finesse planar microcavity10—together with the related anomalous Hall drift. The microcavity hosts strongly coupled exciton–photon modes (exciton polaritons) that are subject to photonic spin–orbit coupling11 from which Dirac cones emerge12, and to exciton Zeeman splitting, breaking time-reversal symmetry. The monopolar and half-skyrmion pseudospin textures are measured using polarization-resolved photoluminescence. The associated quantum geometry of the bands is extracted, enabling prediction of the anomalous Hall drift, which we measure independently using high-resolution spatially resolved epifluorescence. Our results unveil the intrinsic chirality of photonic modes, the cornerstone of topological photonics13–15. These results also experimentally validate the semiclassical description of wavepacket motion in geometrically non-trivial bands9,16.

abstract = {Recent progress on nonlinear properties of parity-time (PT)-symmetric systems is comprehensively reviewed in this article. PT symmetry started out in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, where complex potentials obeying PT symmetry could exhibit all-real spectra. This concept later spread out to optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, electronic circuits, and many other physical fields, where a judicious balancing of gain and loss constitutes a PT-symmetric system. The natural inclusion of nonlinearity into these PT systems then gave rise to a wide array of new phenomena which have no counterparts in traditional dissipative systems. Examples include the existence of continuous families of nonlinear modes and integrals of motion, stabilization of nonlinear modes above PT-symmetry phase transition, symmetry breaking of nonlinear modes, distinctive soliton dynamics, and many others. In this article, nonlinear PT-symmetric systems arising from various physical disciplines are presented, nonlinear properties of these systems are thoroughly elucidated, and relevant experimental results are described. In addition, emerging applications of PT symmetry are pointed out.},

A maximum in the polariton distribution that shifts towards lower energies with increasing pump power or temperature is shown, in agreement with recent experiments. Above a critical pump power, macroscopic occupancies (5 × 104) can be achieved in the lowest-energy polariton state.

abstract = {The interaction between light and matter can give rise to novel topological states. This principle was recently exemplified in Floquet topological insulators, where classical light was used to induce a topological electronic band structure. Here, in contrast, we show that mixing single photons with excitons can result in new topological polaritonic states-or "topolaritons." Taken separately, the underlying photons and excitons are topologically trivial. Combined appropriately, however, they give rise to nontrivial polaritonic bands with chiral edge modes allowing for unidirectional polariton propagation. The main ingredient in our construction is an exciton-photon coupling with a phase that winds in momentum space. We demonstrate how this winding emerges from the finite-momentum mixing between s-type and p-type bands in the electronic system and an applied Zeeman field.We discuss the requirements for obtaining a sizable topological gap in the polariton spectrum and propose practical ways to realize topolaritons in semiconductor quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.},

In the Coulomb-blockade regime of single-electron tunneling, we find that such a weak link acts as a "spin splitter" of the spin states of Cooper pairs tunneling through the link, to an extent that depends on the direction of the electric field. We show that the Josephson current is sensitive to interference between the resulting two transmission channels, one where the spins of both members of a Cooper pair are preserved and one where they are both flipped. As a result, the current is a periodic function of the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and of the bending angle of the nanowire (when mechanically bent); an identical effect appears due to strain-induced spin-orbit coupling. In contrast, no spin-orbit induced interference effect can influence the current through a single weak link connecting two normal metals.},

For this purpose we investigate the spatiotemporal coherence properties of polariton condensates in GaAs-based microcavities under continuous-wave pumping. The chaotic behavior of the instability results in a strongly reduced spatial and temporal coherence and a significantly inhomogeneous density. Additionally we show how the instability can be tamed by introducing a periodic potential so that condensation occurs into negative mass states, leading to largely improved coherence and homogeneity.

Specifically, the valley degree of freedom, which remained largely unexplored until the advent of these materials, is highly attractive in this context as it provides an optically accessible route for the control and manipulation of electron spin.

The conserved spin Hall conductance $\sigma$xys (see text) and its two components, i.e., the conventional term $\sigma$xys0 and the spin-torque-dipole term $\sigma$xys$\tau$, are numerically calculated, which show a series of plateaus as a function of the electron Fermi energy $\epsilon$F. A consistent two-band analysis, as well as a Berry-phase interpretation, is also given. We show that these plateaus are a consequence of various Fermi-surface topologies when tuning $\epsilon$F. In particular, we predict that compared to the case with the Fermi surface encircling the $\Gamma$ point in the Brillouin zone, the amplitude of the spin Hall conductance with the Fermi surface encircling the K points is twice enhanced, which makes it highly meaningful in the future to systematically carry out studies of the K -valley spintronics. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We report on a peculiar propagation of bosons loaded by a short Laguerre-Gaussian pulse in a nearly flat band of a lattice potential. Taking a system of exciton-polaritons in a kagome lattice as an example, we show that an initially localized condensate propagates in a specific direction in space if anisotropy is taken into account. This propagation consists of quantum jumps, collapses, and revivals of the whole compact states, and it persists given any direction of anisotropy. This property reveals its signatures in the tight-binding model and, surprisingly, it is much more pronounced in a continuous model. Quantum revivals are robust to the repulsive interaction and finite lifetime of the particles. Since no magnetic field or spin-orbit interaction is required, this system provides a new kind of easily implementable optical logic.},

abstract = {The new class of phenomena described in this review is based on the interaction between spatially separated, but closely located ferromagnets and superconductors, the so-called ferromagnet-superconductor hybrids (FSH). Typical FSH are: coupled uniform and textured ferromagnetic and superconducting films, magnetic dots over a superconducting film, magnetic nanowires in a superconducting matrix, etc. The interaction is provided by the magnetic field generated by magnetic textures and supercurrents. The magnetic flux from magnetic structures or topological defects can pin vortices or create them, changing the transport properties and transition temperature of the superconductor. On the other hand, the magnetic field from supercurrents (vortices) strongly interacts with the magnetic subsystem, leading to formation of coupled magnetic-superconducting topological defects. The proximity of ferromagnetic layer dramatically changes the properties of the superconducting film. The exchange field in ferromagnets not only suppresses the Cooper-pair wavefunction, but also leads to its oscillations, which in turn leads to oscillations of observable values: the transition temperature and Josephson current. In particular, in the ground state of the Josephson junction the relative phase of two superconductors separated by a layer of ferromagnetic metal is equal to $\pi$ instead of the usual zero (the so-called $\pi$-junction). Such a junction carries a spontaneous supercurrent and possesses other unusual properties. Theory predicts that rotation of magnetization transforms s-pairing into p-pairing. The latter is not suppressed by the exchange field and serves as a carrier of long-range interaction between superconductors. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis Group Ltd.},

In the limit of low-energy and low-momentum scattering, where we can ignore the composite nature of the excitons, we obtain exact analytical expressions for the spin-triplet and spin-singlet interaction strengths, which go beyond the Born approximation employed in previous calculations. Crucially, we find that the strong light-matter coupling enhances the strength of polariton-polariton interactions compared to that of the exciton-exciton interactions, with the latter vanishing in the zero-momentum limit. We furthermore show that the polariton interactions have a highly non-trivial dependence on the number of layers N, and we highlight the important role played by the optically dark states that exist in multiple layers. In particular, we predict that the singlet interaction strength is stronger than the triplet one for a wide range of parameters in most of the currently used transition medal dichalcogenides.

We demonstrate controlled loading into distinct energy bands by modifying the size and shape of the excitation beam. The observed effects are comprehensively described in the framework of a nonequilibrium model of polariton condensation.

We show that polarization-dependent tunnel coupling of microcavity pillars leads to the emergence of the effective spin-orbit interaction consisting of the Dresselhaus and Rashba terms, similar to the case of polaritonic graphene studied earlier. The appearance of the effective spin-orbit interaction combined with the time-reversal symmetry breaking resulting from the application of the magnetic field leads to the nontrivial topological properties of the Bloch bundles of polaritonic wave function. These are manifested in the opening of the gap in the band structure and topological edge states localized on the boundary. Such states are analogs of the edge states arising in topological insulators. Our study of polarization properties of the edge states clearly demonstrates that opening of the gap is associated with the band inversion in the region of the Dirac points of the Brillouin zone where the two bands corresponding to polaritons of opposite polarizations meet. For one particular type of boundary we observe a highly nonlinear energy dispersion of the edge state which makes a polaritonic kagome lattice a promising system for observation of edge state solitons.},

Here, we report that polaritons in MoSe 2 show an efficient retention of the valley pseudospin contrasting them with excitons and trions in this material. We find that the degree of the valley pseudospin retention is dependent on the photon, exciton and trion fractions in the polariton states. This allows us to conclude that in the polaritonic regime, cavity-modified exciton relaxation inhibits loss of the valley pseudospin.

However, different representations of the continuum theory lead to different low-energy formulations because different representations may entangle light and matter, transforming orbitals into light-matter hybrid states before the projection. In particular, a multicenter Power-Zienau-Woolley transformation yields a dipolar Hamiltonian which incorporates the light-matter coupling via both Peierls phases and a polarization density. We compare this dipolar gauge Hamiltonian and the straightforward Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional solid to describe subcycle light-driven electronic motion in the semiclassical limit and a coupling of the solid to a quantized cavity mode which renormalizes the band-structure into electron-polariton bands. Both descriptions yield the same result when many bands are taken into account but the dipolar Hamiltonian is more accurate when the model is restricted to few electronic bands, while the Coulomb Hamiltonian requires fewer electromagnetic modes.},

abstract = {Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities have become a model system for the studies of dynamical Bose-Einstein condensation, macroscopic coherence, many-body effects, nonclassical states of light and matter, and possibly quantum phase transitions in a solid state. These low-mass bosonic quasiparticles can condense at comparatively high temperatures up to 300 K, and preserve the fundamental properties of the condensate, such as coherence in space and time domain, even when they are out of equilibrium with the environment. Although the presence of a confining potential is not strictly necessary in order to observe Bose-Einstein condensation, engineering of the polariton confinement is a key to controlling, shaping, and directing the flow of polaritons. Prototype polariton-based optoelectronic devices rely on ultrafast photon-like velocities and strong nonlinearities exhibited by polaritons, as well as on their tailored confinement. Nanotechnology provides several pathways to achieving polariton confinement, and the specific features and advantages of different methods are discussed in this review. Being hybrid exciton-photon quasiparticles, polaritons can be trapped via their excitonic as well as photonic component, which leads to a wide choice of highly complementary trapping techniques. Here, we highlight the almost free choice of the confinement strengths and trapping geometries that provide powerful means for control and manipulation of the polariton systems both in the semi-classical and quantum regimes. Furthermore, the possibilities to observe effects of the polariton blockade, Mott insulator physics, and population of higher-order energy bands in sophisticated lattice potentials are discussed. Observation of such effects could lead to realization of novel polaritonic non-classical light sources and quantum simulators.},

abstract = {The BCS theory of superconductivity is generalized to the case of a position-dependent energy gap (at the absolute zero of temperature and in the absence of magnetic fields). The BCS integral equation for the energy gap goes over into an integro-differential equation. The latter has nontrivial solutions (i.e., finite energy gap) even for the case of normal material (V=0). Expressions are obtained for the energy gap, for the volume energy density, and for the surface energy density at an interface, for both normal and superconducting material. These results are applied to a number of problems involving superconducting contacts. When a thin slice of normal material is sandwiched between bulk superconductors, it is found that the slice acts superconducting for thicknesses less than about 10-5 cm. When a thin slice of superconductor is sandwiched between bulk normal material, the slice acts like normal material for thicknesses less than about 10-5 cm. The energy gap at the free surface of a bulk superconductor may differ by as much as thirty percent from its constant value deep inside the material, the former being either larger or smaller than the latter, depending on the value of N(0)V, where N(0) is the density of one-electron states of a given spin at the Fermi level in the normal metal. {\textcopyright} 1960 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Harder2020,
abstract = {In recent years, novel two-dimensional materials such as graphene, bismuthene and transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable interest due to their unique physical properties. A range of physical effects can be transferred to the realms of photonics by creating artificial photonic lattices emulating these two-dimensional materials. Here, exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities offer an exciting opportunity to study a part-light, part-matter quantum fluid of light in a complex lattice potential. In this paper, we study exciton-polaritons in a two-dimensional Lieb lattice of buried optical traps. The {\$}S{\$} and {\$}P{\_}{\{}xy{\}}{\$} photonic orbitals of such a Lieb lattice give rise to the formation of two flatbands which are of greatest interest for the distortion-free storage of compact localized states. By using a well controlled etch-and-overgrowth technique, we manage to control the trapping as well as the site couplings with great precision. This allows us to spectroscopically monitor the flatness of the flatbands across the full Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that these flatbands can be directly populated by condensation under non-resonant laser excitation. Finally, using this advanced device approach we demonstrate resonant and deterministic excitation of flatband modes in transmission geometry. Our findings establish the exciton-polariton systems as a highly controllable, optical many-body system to study flatband effects and for distortion-free storage of compact localized states.},

abstract = {We present a scheme of interaction-induced topological band structures based on the spin anisotropy of exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. We predict theoretically that this scheme allows the engineering of topological gaps, without requiring a magnetic field or strong spin-orbit interaction (transverse electric-transverse magnetic splitting). Under nonresonant pumping we find that an initially topologically trivial system undergoes a topological transition upon the spontaneous breaking of phase symmetry associated with polariton condensation. Under either nonresonant or resonant coherent pumping we find that it is also possible to engineer a topological dispersion that is linear in wave vector - a property associated with polariton superfluidity.},

@article{Chubukov2020,
abstract = {We analyze the validity of Eliashberg theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in 2D systems in light of recent extensive Monte-Carlo studies of the Holstein model. Conventional wisdom says that Eliashberg theory is applicable as long as vertex corrections remain small. For small ratio of the phonon energy $\Omega$0 and the Fermi energy EF, this condition is supposed to hold even when the dimensionless electron–phonon coupling $\lambda$ is larger than one, i.e., in the strong coupling regime. A comparison between various quantities computed in the Migdal approximation and those computed by Quantum Monte Carlo prove that this belief is wrong, and we identify analytically some of the ways in which this breakdown occurs for various “normal state” properties at $\lambda$=$\lambda$cr, where $\lambda$cr=O(1). The breakdown occurs at temperatures high enough that neither superconducting nor charge–density wave correlations extend over any significant range of distances, so it cannot be associated with the onset of an instability toward any of the relevant ordered ground-states — rather it is associated with the local physics of classical bipolaron formation. Still, we show that certain properties, including the superconducting Tc and the superconducting gap structure below Tc, can be accurately inferred from the strong-coupling limit of Eliashberg theory at $\lambda$≤$\lambda$cr.},

@article{Huber2010,
abstract = {We derive effective Hamiltonians for lattice bosons with strong geometrical frustration of the kinetic energy by projecting the interactions on the flat lowest Bloch band. Specifically, we consider the Bose Hubbard model on the one-dimensional sawtooth lattice and the two-dimensional kagome lattice. Starting from a strictly local interaction the projection gives rise to effective long-range terms stabilizing a supersolid phase at densities above $\nu$c =1/9 of the kagome lattice. In the sawtooth lattice on the other hand we show that the solid order, which exists at the magic filling $\nu$c =1/4, is unstable to further doping. The universal low-energy properties at filling 1/4+$\delta$$\nu$ are described by the well-known commensurate-incommensurate transition. We support the analytic results by detailed numerical calculations using the density-matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization. Finally, we discuss possible realizations of the models using ultracold atoms as well as frustrated quantum magnets in high magnetic fields. We compute the momentum distribution and the noise correlations, that can be extracted from time of flight experiments or neutron scattering, and point to signatures of the unique supersolid phase of the kagome lattice. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},
