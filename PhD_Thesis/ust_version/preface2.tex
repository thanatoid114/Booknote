        Where the F... is Meng? (A beetroot song)
    \end{center}
    (Merab and Yagmur start)\\
    Yagmur called when she got the word,\\
    She said, I suppose you've heard about Meng
    Well, I rushed to his office, and I looked inside\\
    I could hardly believe my eyes\\
    As a final draft of the thesis is on his device\\
    \\
    Chorus (everyone)\\
    Oh, I don't know why he's leaving,\\
    or where he's gonna go\\
    I guess he's got his reasons\\
    but I just don't want to know\\
    'Cos for last four years\\
    I've been living next door to Meng\\
    \\
    Recent four years observing how he puts\\
    In light--matter cavity sequential beetroots Now I've got to get to used\\
    to not living next door to Meng\\
    \\
    (All PhD students and everyone)\\
    We studied together condensed matter and stuff,\\
    Meng always complained Ivan is too tough\\
    Poor Meng\\
    Now he walks through the door\\
    with his head held high\\
    As if he knows someting of matter and light\\
    Meng, just relax\\
    let's have a party tonight\\
    \\
    Chorus (everyone)\\
    Oh, I don't know why he's leaving,
    or where he's gonna go\\
    I guess he's got his reasons\\
    but I just don't wanna know\\
    'Cos for last for years\\
    I've been living next door to Meng\\
    \\
    Recent four years observing how he puts\\
    In light--matter cavity sequential beetroots Now I've got ot get uesd\\
    to not living next door to Meng\\
    \\
    (Merab and Yagmur)\\
    And then Ihor called and asked\\
    how I felt\\
    And he said, hey I know\\
    how to help -- get over Meng\\
    He said Meng is gone\\
    but I'm still here\\
    You know I've been waiting for long three years\\
    To learn Korean, my dear\\
    \\
    Chorus (everyone)\\
    Oh, why he's not leaving,\\
    or why he's not gone\\
    I guess he's got his reasons\\
    Some Korean must be learned\\
    'Cos for last four years\\
    He's been living next door to Meng\\
    \\
    Recent four years observing how Meng puts\\
    In light--matter cavity sequential beetroots Now he's got to get uesd\\
    to not living next door to Meng\\
    \\
    No we'll never get uesd\\
    to not living next door to Meng
